                                    <p>Religion is viewed as an institutional activity that enhances behavior and conduct to make life easier. Religion is something you believe, do, or accept. Religion is a vital aspect of life in every community. In Nepal, religion plays a vital role. The social life of the Nepalese includes belief in God, the expectation of sin and virtue, worship, songs, Kirtan, fairs, and Jatra, among other things. There are adherents of numerous religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. There is the largest concentration of Hindus. There are numerous sects within Hinduism, including the Shaiva sect, Shakta worshipers of Shakti, Baishnav devotees of Bishnu, and Ganapati devotees of Ganesh.&nbsp;Due to the absence of religious conflict and the coexistence of followers of several religions in one community, Nepal has also earned the reputation of being a location of religious tolerance. The aims, beliefs, and hopes of people and society take precedence over religious convictions. The Nepali society is an example of a place where religion permeates every aspect of a person&#39;s life, from conception to death, and where religious tolerance holds communities and society as a whole together.
                                    

<p>Religion and religious convictions are widely acknowledged in Nepal, which was formerly known as the Hindu Kingdom. The secularism of younger generations, non-Hindus, and educated communities appears to be prioritized. Nepal has been proclaimed a secular country at the House of Representatives&#39; inaugural session.</p>

<p>According to the 2068 national census, the nation is home to ten different religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Kirat, Christianity, Prakriti, Bone, Jainism, Bahaism, and Sikhism. Hindus made up 81.3 percent of the population in 2068, up from the census of 2058&#39;s 80.8 percent, which showed a rise. 9 percent of the people identify as Buddhist. Islam, Kirat, Christianity, and nature are all held in 4.4, 3.0, 1.4, and 0.4 percent of the population, respectively. The following is a quick discussion of the major faiths in Nepal:</p>

<h3>Hinduism (Hindu Religion)</h3>

<p>Hinduism is regarded as the world&#39;s oldest religion, not just in Nepal. Hinduism is a religion that has existed forever and has been practiced for a very long time. Hinduism is referred to as an eternal religion since God, not any particular person, practices it. There are many names for Hinduism, including Sanatan Dharma, Vedic religion, and Aarya religion. It also goes by the name of the way of life. Hindu is a very old word, as the Indian Ocean attests. The Sanskrit poem Merutantra uses the word Hindu. In books like Adbhut Kosh, Ramkosh, Hemant Kosh, and Shabdakalpadrum, the word &quot;Hindu&quot; is used. Hindu was a term used in Persian religious texts. An Arabic poet named Labi-Win-A-Akhtav-Win-A-Akhtab-Bin-A-Turfa used the word Hindu in his composition some 4,000 years ago.</p>

<p>Hindu is defined as &quot;caste or religion which views the Vedas, theology, ethics, and Puranas etc. as their texts&quot; in the Nepali Brihyat dictionary. Some people also think that the word &quot;Hindu&quot; derives from the Indus River. People from Hindustan are commonly referred to as Hindus. A similar tradition regards as Hindus everyone who worships cows, considers Omkar to be a mascot, believes in pregnancies, and forbids aggression. Hindus are defined as people who adhere to the Hindu Dharma Kosh and believe in both God and the Vedic writings. Similar to this, those who follow the Vedic religion and worship deities like Narayana are also referred to as Hindus.</p>

<p>The central principle of Hinduism, according to Maharishi Vyas, is that &quot;doing good to others is religion, and injuring others is a sin&quot; (Paropakar Punnyaya, Papaya Parapidanam). Kindness, honesty, helping others, love, and other virtues are therefore regarded as forms of religion. Hindu religions hold that God has had various incarnations and forms. The Deity of Thirty-Three Crores is worshipped by Hindus. According to Hinduism, Maheshwar is the destroyer, Bishnu is the servant, and Brahma is the creator.</p>

<p>Hinduism&#39;s primary scriptures include the Vedas, Puranas, Upanishads, Mahabharata, Gita, Ramayana, Manusmriti, and others. The first book written by humans is the Rigveda. In the beginning, there was only one Vedas, but Maharishi Vedavas is thought to have divided it into four sections for the convenience of the ordinary man: the Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samveda, and Atharvaveda. The Vedas are the foundation of the Hindu religion. In addition to the Vedas, the Gita and eighteen Puranas have also been recognized as sacred texts. The Mahabharata and the Ramayana are considered histories. Numerous books have been written about Hinduism.</p>

<p>Hinduism itself contains numerous sects. There are two sects within this religion namely called as Baam Marga and Dakshin Marga. According to various scholars, Hinduism has more than 1500 divisions or denominations as a result of the changing times and the introduction of diverse ideas. Shaiva, Baishnav, Shakta, and Sanatan are the four main religions.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Shaiva Sect</strong>: This sect&#39;s adherents worship Lord Shiva in all of his incarnations. Hinduism refers to Brahma, Bishnu, and Maheshwar/Shiva as the Trimurti. Shiva is the third of them, and his unique duty is to demolish. The scene following the eradication is portrayed as a lovely morning following the conclusion of the dark night. Shiva has so come to represent auspiciousness, wellbeing, and goodness. In Nepal, also called Pashupat Area, there are many Shaivites. One of the fundamental principles of the Pashupat Sect is the breaking of ethnic barriers and the unfettered access to all personalities. The following three things are given particular importance by the Shaiva sect:

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Husband:</strong>

		<ul>
			<li>Shiva is the husband who bestows fruit in line with a creature&#39;s actions.</li>
			<li>Shiva is all-seeing.</li>
			<li>Shiva has four parts, Mantra, Manteshwar, Maheshwar, and Mukta.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Animal:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Only once the creature has broken the loop or link in the community may the creature approach Shiva.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Loop:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>It is said that in order to achieve salvation, any creature must escape from these traps in order to liberate themselves from the four bindings of the mind, karma/activity, love to action, and reserve power.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Baishnava sect:</strong> The worship of Lord Bishnu is known as baishnava. This viewpoint&#39;s adherents regard Haribhajan as the primary means of redemption. The primary texts supporting this viewpoint are the Bhagwat Purana, Bishnu Purana, Harivansh Purana, etc. The Baishnava sect is currently becoming more widely advertised in Nepal.</li>
	<li><strong>Shakta Sect:</strong> This group derives its strength from the Vedas, which encourage superstition, goddess worship, and other superstitions. The Vedas give birth to the idea of strong women like Wakas, Saraswati, Shraddha, and others. The Dakshinachar and Bamachar sects were also founded within the Shakta religion. While Bamachar followed the Panchamkar (wine, meat, fish, money, and sex) as a matter of practice, Dakshinchar stuck to the Vedic way. Since the Malla era, occultism has been practiced in Nepal, and the Sakta Sect has grown in popularity.</li>
	<li><strong>Sanatan Sampradaya:&nbsp;</strong>The Sanatan Sampradaya is the most influential sect and has the majority of Hindu adherents. This sect is viewed as being excessively democratic and lax. It practices equal worship of all the gods. In Nepal, there are a lot of Sanatan Hindus.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are many well-known Hindu holy sites in Nepal, including Pashupatinath, Muktinath, Barahakshetra, Ruruchhetra, Guheshwari, Budhanilakantha, Dakshinkali, Shobha Bhagwati, Mrigasthali, Manakamana, Deuti Bajyai, Padukasthan, Nabisthan, Siristhan, Kagabeni, Swarg Special festivals and Tithis are celebrated in these many temples and Shakti Peethas through worship, vows, sacrifices, etc. Hindus celebrate various holidays and occasions, such as Dashain, Tihar, Chhath, Holi, Mahashivaratri, Raksha Bandhan, Gaura, Ramanavami, Matha Tirtha Aaunshi, Teej, Swastani, Purnima, Baishakh Purnima, Shri Krishna Janmashtami, Saune Sankranti, Maghe Sankranti, Maha Puja, Gaijatra, Indrajatra, Bis</p>

<p>According to the number of adherents, Hinduism is the first and third most popular religion in the world in Nepal. The two primary centers of the Hindu religion are in Nepal and India. Hinduism is practiced in Bhutan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malaysia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, the Marshall Islands, Suriname, Guyana, and other places. Hinduism has benefited greatly from the contributions of saints like Swami Bibekananda, Sai Baba, Prajapati, Brahma, Maharshi Raman, Khaptadbaba, Mahatma Gandhi, and Kalibaba.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Buddhism (Bouddha Religion)</h3>

<p>Buddhism is the second-largest religion in Nepal and the fourth-largest religion worldwide. It was created by Gautam Buddha, the son of King Suddhodan and queen Mayadevi, who was born in Lumbini, Nepal, in 563 BC on the day of Baishakh Shukla Purnima. Siddhartha Gautam is the true name of Gautam Buddha. The early years of Siddhartha Gautam were spent in luxury and leisure. He married Yashodhara when he was sixteen years old. Rahul was the name of Siddhartha&#39;s son. Siddhartha became depressed upon seeing the old man, the patient, the dead, and the monk. He left his family at age 29 and headed off into the night in search of knowledge.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that Buddha was born on Baisakha Shukla Purnima in 563 BC, gained Buddhahood on that day in 453 BC, and attained Nirvana on that day in 453 BC, the nation celebrates that day as Buddha Jayanti. Large gatherings take place on this day in Buddhist Ghumbas and Monasteries.</p>

<p>The primary source of suffering, according to Gautam Buddha, the creator and proponent of Buddhism, is thirst, which we can quench to find Nirvana or salvation. Buddha regarded separation, accident, old age, illness, and death as forms of grief. There are octagonal or eight-vision paths, such as right perspective, right resolve, right speech, right behavior, right livelihood, right endeavor, and right Samadhi, that can be followed to prevent experiencing suffering. The Panchsheel idea was introduced by Buddha. These are the five directions that a person should follow, according to Buddhism:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Don&#39;t lie (speak the truth).</li>
	<li>Don&#39;t steal.</li>
	<li>Don&#39;t involve in violence.</li>
	<li>Do not drink alcohol.</li>
	<li>Don&#39;t have affair/relation with other&#39;s wife (to be celibate).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the four noble truth and eight fold paths that the Buddha preaches:</p>

<p><strong>Four Noble Truths:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Suffering: Life is miserable.</li>
	<li>Grief community: There is a cause for suffering.</li>
	<li>Prevention of grief: There is resistance to suffering.</li>
	<li>Prevention of grief - Gamini Pratipad: The means of achieving the control of suffering. There are 8 great formulas to be used to prevent this.</li>

<p>There are 84000 religious songs in Tripitak, all of which were penned in Pali. The three Buddhist doctrines found in the Tripitaka are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Sutrapitak</strong>:

	<ul>
		<li>The teachings of Gautama Buddha.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Binayapitak</strong>:
	<ul>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Abhidharmapitak</strong>:
	<ul>
		<li>The philosophy of Buddha is connected to several topics. Buddhists refer to their place of worship as a monastery, bihar, gumba, or stupa. Buddhism, which promotes non-violence and good deeds, forbids caste prejudice and untouchability and is regarded as a scientific religion. Numerous sects of Buddhism emerged following the death of the Buddha. Numerous sects, like the Jimna, Kagruyd, Sakya, and Gellog sects, have developed throughout the world. There are three primary communities in Nepal: Mahayan, Hinayan or Therabad (short car), and Bajrayan. Mahayanis revere the statue of the Buddha. In the devotional mahayana, which has a sense of Bodhisattva, good faith, charity, generosity, etc. are given prominence. Mahayanis consider Lamas as religious leaders, while Mahayanis believe only in the Buddha&#39;s original teachings without believing in idolatry and Lamas. Bajrayani emphasizes the occult and yoga practice. The Newar Bajracharyas of Nepal are considered to belong to the Bajrayani sect. Here are some of the best known Buddhist international Mahabihars:
		<ul>
			<li>Swayambhu Mahabihar: Nepal</li>
			<li>Bikramshila Mahabihar: India</li>
			<li>Takshashila Mahabihar: Pakistan</li>
			<li>Tamrashila Mahabihar: Sri Lanka</li>
			<li>Swornashil Mahabihar: Thailand</li>
			<li>Tripitaka Mahabihar: Tibet</li>
		</ul>

<p><strong>The four religious places of Buddhism</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lumbini: Buddha&#39;s birthplace.</li>
	<li>Bodhgaya: Got Wisdom/ Buddhahood.</li>
	<li>Sarnath: The place of the first sermon.</li>
	<li>Kushinagar: A place where he died.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The meaning of five colours related to Buddhism are:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Blue: body of the Buddha</li>
	<li>Yellow: bone of the Buddha</li>
	<li>Red: Buddha&#39;s blood</li>
	<li>Kaleji: Buddha&#39;s remains</li>
	<li>White: Buddha&#39;s teeth</li>
</ul>

<p>This religion had already reached all of India by the time it was 500 years old, and in the following 2000 years it had spread to all of East Asia. The Kushan dynasty&#39;s kings sought to advance Buddhism in the first and second centuries following its founding. In the third century, Buddhism steadily spread to Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Burma, and Thailand. It progressively spread from China to Japan and Korea in the fourth century. Buddhism had already spread to Nepal, India, China, Korea, Japan, and Cambodia by the seventh century. The majority of idols constructed worldwide bear Buddha&#39;s name. The phrase &quot;land of the Buddha&quot; refers to Thailand. What is now a source of national pride for all Nepalis.</p>

<h3>Islamism (Islam Religion)</h3>

<p>Prophet Muhammad is regarded as the creator and propagator of Islam. He was born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in the year 570 A.D. He is also referred to as Muhammad Sallallahu Alayhi or Sallam by Muslims. Muhammad was an orphan from birth and is the only descendant of father Abdullah and mother Amina. Muhammad was raised by his grandfather Muttalib after his mother passed away when he was just seven years old. Muhammad was born amid extreme suffering.</p>

<p>Muhammad, who was forty years old, gained supernatural authority from the angel Gabriel while meditating and worshiping on the Hira mountain near Mecca on the night of Ramadan.</p>

<p>Read the name of the God you created, who formed man from a drop of blood, the same angel replied to him. I am Gabriel, and you are God&#39;s messenger. He related the story to his wife. He was pleasantly informed by his wife Khadija that you would become a prophet. Muhammad&#39;s faith grew in new religions in a genuine way. He started to experience supernatural visions. He started to speak with a word from God. He started out by stating that Allah is the sole God. He ran for office by advocating that everyone have faith in Allah. Mohammed wasn&#39;t widely accepted as God&#39;s messenger at first. He began teaching religion for the first time from a small group that subsequently became known as Islam faith, along with his wife, friends Abu Bakr and Uthman, and his family. The traditionalists in Mecca attacked his religion when he initially began to preach there. Then he traveled to Medina to spread his religious message. The locals were impacted. This is how the religion of Islam evolved. Muhammad returned to Mecca with the help of the people of Madina, destroyed all the idols, and outlawed the worship of them.</p>

<p>Islam is the Arabic word for peaceful submission to Allah. Muslims are the name for this religion&#39;s adherents. In a same vein, a Muslim is someone who is committed to Allah. The central tenet of the Islamic faith is that Muhammad is a prophet or messenger of Allah, who is Almighty, the one God, and the protector of the cosmos. Islam is a religion that honors Hazrat Mohammed. He preached in order to end suffering in the world. The tenets of this religion include kindness, upright behavior, promoting the truth, helping the suffering, and defending religion. Muslims adhere to their sacred texts and believe in Allah or God. The Qur&#39;an, which literally translates as &quot;to be pronounced,&quot; is the name of Islam&#39;s sacred text. The teachings of the Qur&#39;an include prayers and religious obligations such as believing in Allah, speaking the truth, abstaining from obscenity and filth, acting justly, respecting others&#39; rights, assisting the poor, feeding the hungry, avoiding personal greed, caring for the sick, earning through justice, acting honestly, working hard to please God, worshipping intensely, giving generously, holding Friday mass in the mosque, among other duties. The following five items are regarded in Islam as necessary for worship.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Prayer:</strong> Prayer is considered by Muslims to be their first obligation. They wake up in the morning, cleanse themselves physically, and then pray. You can bend down to Allah when praying or you can stand or sit while doing so.</li>
	<li><strong>Zakat: </strong>Zakat is known as giving 2.5% of one&#39;s salary to the needy, the poor, traveling borrowers, family members, etc..</li>
	<li><strong>Roja (Fasting):</strong> Fasting is referred to as roja (roja). The ninth month&#39;s period of fasting, which lasts from dawn till sunset, is known as Rosa in the Arabic calendar. Fasting is practiced to promote equality between people. It teaches endurance, self-control, submission, and attentiveness.</li>
	<li><strong>Hajj: </strong>The term &quot;Hajj&quot; refers to the annual pilgrimage that Muslims make to Mecca and Madina. It takes this kind of adoration to develop a sense of shared humanity.</li>
	<li><strong>Assistance to Islam:</strong> The help of Islam is to prepare Muslims for any kind of sacrifice for humanity.</li>
</ul>

<p>The mosque is the name of Islam&#39;s primary place of worship. Islam&#39;s primary places of pilgrimage include Mecca, Medina, Damascus, Jerusalem, etc. Ramadan, Eid ul Fitra, Bakr Eid, and Eid are the main holidays. Five times a day, Islamists read Nawaz. They maintain their fast for the entire month of Ramadan. The name of this fast is Roza. Eid ul Fitra is the name for the final day of the fast. After Muhammad&#39;s passing, the sects of Sunni and Siya emerged. The Sunni sect is adhered to by nearly 90% of all followers of Islam. In Islam, there are other sects besides the Sunni and Siya sects, including the Hanafi, Sufi, Bohora, and Ahamadiya. The weakest aspects of this religion have been perceived to be religious fanaticism and the pitiful treatment of women. Muslims have been faithfully residing in Nepal&#39;s Terai region, as well as several highland regions, such as the Kathmandu Valley, since the reign of the medieval monarch Ratna Mall. 11.62,360 people, or 4.4 percent of Nepal&#39;s total population, are Muslims, according to the national census taken in 2068.</p>

<h3>Christianity (Christian Religion)</h3>

<p>Christianity is the most popular religion in the world and ranks fifth in terms of followership in Nepal. Christianity was founded by Jesus Christ. He has a mother named Mary and a father named Joseph. When he was born in Bethlehem, Judea, close to the Israeli city of Jerusalem, in 4 B.C., his parents sought refuge in the herd. The infant in Jerusalem was used to consecrate the God&#39;s temple. Up until the age of twelve, even Jesus was brought to the temple annually. According to Western academics, he arrived in India and Tibet after serving for 12 years. John the Baptist was his teacher. Jesus began his missionary travels at the age of 30 to share his religion.</p>

<p>He was a reformer of religion. He continued by saying that if a person has devotion to God, their physical infirmity would be cured and numerous physical diseases would be eliminated. Many of the ghostly, plague, and paralyzed patients were cured by him. He felt for the people in general. He supported reformist principles. He underlined the value of treating others with respect. He mentioned forgiveness. He didn&#39;t think of people as being small or large. He used to eat dinner with members of the lower social groups. As a result, his notoriety grew over time. He supported the idea of bringing about the reign of God in the earth. He is regarded by Christians as the Son of God.&nbsp;Christianity holds that there is only one God who is also omniscient and powerful. God is ideal from a moral standpoint. He is endowed with compassion, intelligence, and eternal vision. God is the just and kind Lord of the world. The entire universe is governed and morally upheld by God. He respects how people behave. Christians thus hold that God makes all decisions. God is said to as the source of love in Christianity. As a result, &quot;The God of Christianity is Good of Love&quot; is stressed in Christianity. Charity, love, and forgiveness are given a special emphasis in Christianity.</p>

<p>As a reformer, Isa&#39;s detractors and conservatives turned violent. All of a sudden, there emerged a plot to kill Jesus. Simon and Andrew were His very first disciples. Judas was one of his top twelve followers who tricked him. In his desire to receive 30 silver coins, he betrayed him. He presented Jesus to the throng. As a result, he was detained, the then-rulers plotted a conspiracy against him, and he was sentenced to death on the basis of a number of false accusations, including blasphemy and insulting the dominant religion and legal system. Jesus said his last words before dying, &quot;Father, I surrender this spirit to you,&quot; and he also expressed forgiveness for his killers. This is the best example of forgiveness. Isa was handed a crown/ mask of thorns, hit viciously and a man named Barabbas was given the responsibility to hang Jesus on a cross and then crucified</p>

<p>The Bible is regarded as Christianity&#39;s most important text. Scripture literally translates as &quot;the book of books.&quot; The Old Testament and the New Testament are the two sections of the Bible. The primary religious text for Jews is the Old Testament. It comprises a history going back to the birth of Jesus and 39 books of the Bible. The New Testament, which includes the final 28 books of the Bible, is the primary source of faith for Christians. wherein Jesus&#39; teachings are collected. As a result, the 66 books that make up the Bible were written in preparation. The Bible was not written by a single person, but rather by numerous people over the course of nearly 1600 years. In Christianity, the emphasis is on avoiding greed and not to assume oneself as weak and slave. The Bible says: &quot;Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute them.&quot; God is viewed as a representation of objectivity. This religion holds that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are the three eternal realities of the same God. The final four tenets of this religion are thought to be reincarnation, judgment, heaven, and hell. The seven deadly sins are laziness, anxiety, fear, greed, work, envy, and eating. The Bible&#39;s two teachings listed below are regarded as the 10 greatest commandments:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Love your God with all your heart and all your understanding,</li>
	<li>Love your neighbor as yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>The main holiday in Christianity is Christmas. Christ&#39;s death and resurrection are commemorated on Christmas Day. Every year on December 25, Christians of all denominations rejoice in the holiday season. Christians visit churches to pray for world peace, love, and hope during this holiday commemorating Jesus Christ&#39;s death on the cross for the atonement of sin. They also share greetings and presents. Epiphany, Easter, Lent, Palm Sunday, the Passion Pledge, Good Friday, Ascension Day, Pentecost Day, and other significant Christian holidays are also celebrated.</p>

<p>The Christian religion has given rise to more than a thousand different denominations. Popular religious groups include Catholic, Protestant, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Pentecostal. There are several Protestant and Catholic religious traditions worldwide. The &quot;Pope&quot; is the title given to the leader of the Roman Catholic sect. Beginning with the Malla era, Christians began to travel to Nepal. In Nepal, the number of Christians has been gradually rising over the past 20 years. In Nepal, 3.65,699 persons, or 1.4 percent of the population, identified as Christians, according to National Census 268.</p>

<h3>Judaism/Jewism/Yahudism (Jewism Religion)</h3>

<p>A guy named Musa was born in a Jewish family in Mesopotamia in 1500 BC. He was the son of Father Amaram and Mother Yothaveda. The ancient kings were incredibly brutal. After the Jews were born, the king issued a proclamation to toss everything into the Nile because he had heard that Israelis would put an end to Egyptians. Musa had to be thrown into the Nile as a result. The newborn Musa was discovered in the river by the king&#39;s daughter as she was taking a bath, and she brought him to the castle out of compassion. By chance, Yothaveda became Musa&#39;s mother and fed him from her breast while he was growing up in the palace. Simporaha was the name of his wife.</p>

<p>Musa left the palace at the age of 40 because he did not enjoy the dominance over and exploitation of the Jews. Muso served as the Jewish people&#39;s leader as they escaped Egypt. Muso built a camp close to Mount Sinai, where he heard the preaching of Jehovah and heard the holy words. He then started to preach the core teachings of Judaism. Jews were always protesting and fighting for their rights. Eventually, on May 15, 1945, a new country called Israel was born, with Judaism as its primary religion. The majority religion of Hebrew-speaking people and Israel is Judaism.</p>

<p>The Old Testament of the Bible is the primary religious text for Jews. This religion accepts the existence of the Prophet (Paigambar) and the Angel (Devadut). Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are revered as prophets by the Jews. Elijah, Los, Hosea, and other figures are regarded as prophets in addition to Musa, who is regarded as the major prophet.</p>

<p>Love, mercy, justice, virtue, charity, and service to the suffering, the weak, and God are all encouraged by this faith. According to their calendar, the Jews observe Ros Ha Sanaha on the occasion of the New Year. Jews gather together to celebrate this occasion, sending each other greetings, eating apples and honey, and wishing each other peace and prosperity.</p>

<h3>Jainism (Jain Religion)</h3>

<p>between 599 and 527 BC, as the youngest or third child of mother Trishala and father Baishali. Mahaveer Bardhaman was born in the Indian state of Bihar&#39;s Baishali State (now Majfarpur). The name Jain is derived from the term &quot;Jin,&quot; which means to master all the senses, master the senses collectively, master the mind, or master speech. Tirthakankar, one of the foremost Jain religious figures, is credited with overcoming all of these urges. As a result, the religion they practiced, known as Jainism, gained popularity. In Jainism, Bardaman appears to have received a lot of attention. Tirthakankar ranked 24th in terms of Jainism. Adinath is the first Tirthakankar. Other names for him include Rishabhdev, Rishabhanath, Prajapati, and Adi Brahma. Similarly, Bardhaman Mahavir is the 24th or the last Tirthakankar. Earlier, there were 23 Tirthakankars already.</p>

<p>Like Buddha, Mahavir was born into a royal family. When he was 28 years old, his parents passed away. When he was 30 years old, Mahavir left the palace and underwent a 12-year period of extreme austerity in silence. He was deep in his meditation. As a result, he gained knowledge and expertise. He spent thirty years preaching nonviolence and wisdom after acquiring Kuvalya knowledge. In Jainism, the trinity of good philosophy, knowledge, and character is revered. The Five Mahabharata contain several guidelines for proper character (Ahimsa, Satya, Astay, Brahmacharya and Aprigraha). It is known as Panchasheel by Buddhists. Jiva (living things/Soul), Ajiva (nonliving stuff), Astrab (effect of bad deeds), Bandh (bondage of karma), Samvar (result of good deeds), Nirajra (eradication of karma), and Moksha are among the seven aspects that are taken into account by the Jain religion (Liberation). We refer to those who possess consciousness and the capacity for knowledge as beings. Among other things, organisms include humans, animals, plants, air, water, and fire. Non-living things are defined as having no consciousness. Non-living materials like wood, stone, etc. The link is thought to have been started by Astrab. The theme enters the soul and warps the human psyche through the senses. Human brains are destroyed by anger, pride, love, hypocrisy, and greed. Bandh is the term for the bond with the organism. To stop karma is to say sambhar. To be free from the bondage of the Karmic organism is Nirajra, but to get rid of the bondage of the soul karma is Moksha.</p>

<p>Jain temples are places of worship for Jainism. The primary temple or center of pilgrimage for Jains is considered to be the Dilwara Temple. On Mount Abu, this temple was constructed. Another well-known Jains&#39; temple is the Ranakpur Temple in Jodhpur. This religion&#39;s adherents worship idols. The three principal deities in this faith are Taditkumar, Asurakumar, and Kadit Achyut. The primary event for Jain devotees is Mahavir Jayanti. Jains join Hindus in celebrating Lakshmi Puja and Dipawali. There are more than 46 religious texts in the Jain tradition.</p>

<p>Jainism is divided into two main sects: Shwetambar and Digambar. While members of the Digambar sect are clotheless, members of the Shwetambar sect dress in white. The followers of Digambar are not permitted to collect any items. Mahavir did not write any books because Jainism is not a religion founded on the Bible. He only preached in the church. The words Mahavir had given them were collected by his followers, who then created a book. Organ texts, epic texts, and autonomous texts are only a few of the divisions that may be made amongst these religious works. With its emphasis on holiness, righteousness, and nonviolence, Jainism has a distinctive identity. 3,214 people in Nepal have converted to Jainism, according to the 2068 national census.</p>

<h3>Shikhism (Shikha Religion)</h3>

<p>Sikhism was founded by Guru Nanak. On April 15, 1469, Guru Nanak was born in Talwandi, Punjab, as the child of Triptakaka and Kaluchandra. The name Nana for a maternal grandfather is Hindi. Given that he was born in his mother&#39;s home, Guru Nanak was also known as Nanak. He was drawn to meditation and Satsang from an early age. His wife was Sulakhini Devi. Two sons were born to them. However, Nankdev abandoned his family and embarked on a tour, satsang, sadhana, and preaching. He too left his house and began looking for God. He took up monasticism and engaged in sadhana. He made an effort to eliminate prejudice between Hindus and Muslims. He demonstrated love, humility, and respect for all races and religions. He traveled on pilgrimages to places like Kashmir, Kausi, Haridwar, Kabul, Mecca, Madinah, and Delhi. It is also thought that Guru Nanak visited Sikkim, Tibet, and Kathmandu. He promoted Sikhism, arguing that an atmosphere devoid of discrimination exists when people have open hearts. Other names for it include Sikhitam, Sikhi, and Sikkha. Sikhism has prioritized philanthropy, hospice care, and nonviolence. In 1549 A.D., he passed away at the age of 70.</p>

<p>Sikh refers to a disciple or an education. It denotes a Guru Nanakdev disciple. The religion that adheres to Guru Nanak&#39;s teachings is another name for this one. Only premature/Aakal males are believed in and accepted by Sikhism. It is a religion centered on God. The brilliance of the Guru is revered and seen as being manifest in this religion. This religion holds that one can access the Aakaal Purush through the Guru (beyond time and space). Akaal Purush are revered in this religion as the Creator, the Almighty, the Unborn, and the Incorruptible. It is believed that leading a godly life involves prayer, fasting, and worshiping God. God is faultless. It is only God. In this religion God is considered to be formless. Following the Guru&#39;s teachings is to serve the unhappy, not to do violence, to eat distributing to others, to be friendly to all and to protect the religion are the major teachings of Shikhism.</p>

<p>The &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; is the name of the religious writings of the Shia faith. Shikhs reject idolatry. The Guru Granth Sahib is regarded as God&#39;s written message. The Gurdwara is the location of hymns and prayers. The sacred sites of Sikhism can be found in places like Amritsar, Anandpur, and Patna. The major Sikhism-related holidays that are cheerfully observed by adherents include Baishakh, Diwali, Holi Guru Prabhu (the Guru&#39;s Birthday), Holla Mohalla Maghi, etc. Five locations in Nepal contain distinct temples, including the handwritten Guru Granth Sahib: Gyaneshwar, Pashupati region, Thapathali, Shobhagavati, and the historic Guru Nanak temple (Balaju) in Kathmandu. This religion has adherents, particularly in India. In the census taken in the year 2068, 609 Shikhs were counted among the overall population of Nepal.</p>

<h3>Kirat Religion</h3>

<p>The religion of Kirat is both traditional and widespread. The Rai, limbu, and other ethnic groups in Nepal&#39;s eastern Himalayas are referred to as kiratis, and the religion they practice is known as kirat. Mahaguru Falgunanda, Sirijanga, Iman Singh Chemjong, as well as the most recent Kirat religious guru Atmananda Lingden, have all played significant roles in the advancement of the Kirat religion. Falgunanda Lingden, who was born in Ilam in 1942, is the ideal Kirat man. He is regarded as the leader of this faith. Mahaguru Falgunanda has also been hailed as a national hero by the government of Nepal.</p>

<p>The Kirats are regarded as worshippers of nature. People worship things like fire, trees, hills, forests, rivers, lakes, soil, and the sky according to this religion. Margagathan is another name for Kirat, a sacred location. God is referred to be &quot;Tageranivuvumang&quot; or &quot;Mang&quot; in Kirati. The primary festivals celebrated by the Kiratis are Udhauli and Udhauli. Kirat religion&#39;s Mandhum is one of its scriptures. The two main deities are Paruhang and Sumnima. All Kiratis worship Mangana once a year.</p>

<p>Similar to the important Hindu festival of Bijayadashami, the annual Chasok Tanganam of the Limbu tribe takes place in the month of Kartik. Newly ripe fruits and grains are offered to the gods at the Chasok Tanganam festival, also known as Nwagi Puja, and people also enjoy eating and drinking at Yalangma, dancing Chayabrung, and singing hakpare songs. This celebration is seen by the Limbu people as a representation of their culture, shared unity, and prosperity.</p>
