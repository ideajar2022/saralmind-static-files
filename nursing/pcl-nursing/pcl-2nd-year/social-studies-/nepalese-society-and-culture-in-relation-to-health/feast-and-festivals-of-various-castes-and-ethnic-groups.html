                                    <p>Nepal is a cosmopolitan, multilingual, and multireligious nation. Even in cultural variety, there is harmony. Since the beginning, the variety of cultures present in this area have been a distinctive fusion. Cultural interchange also occurs as a result of the principle of cultural diversity. With pride, it can be mentioned that Nepal is a nation where a common culture has been formed.</p>

<p>People of various religious beliefs have lived in Nepal from the beginning of time. People have been celebrating various festivals for pleasure and to visit family since ancient times, often under the influence of religious feelings. Every festival has been created and is occasionally observed by different individuals.</p>

<p>In Nepal, Hinduism and Buddhism are the two main religions practiced. Islam, Christianity, Kirant, Sikhism, and other religions are equally free in addition to these. These religions have been discovered to change over time into several sects and sub-sects, and as a result, they observe various festivals. People in Nepal celebrate several holidays in accordance with their respective religions for fun according to the season virtually all year long. In Nepali culture, it is customary to revere the natural world, ancestors, and mystical spirits. Masto is performed in Western Nepal, Chandi and Devi are practiced in the eastern hills, Sansari Mai are practiced in the Terai region, and Hinduism is believed in the Himalayan region. In the month of Baishakh, Bhaktapur celebrates Bisakat Jatra on the occasion of the New Year. Buddha Purnima is observed on the Baishakh full moon day. Since Kumar was born on the day of Jestha Shukla Sasthi, Sithi Jatra is observed. The Newar caste celebrates this Jatra in honor of their City Naakha (Lineage Deity/Kul Devata). Islam community observes Eid holiday throughout Ashar month. Similarly, Shakranti and Purnima festivals are observed every month. There are many festivals that are observed, including Nagapanchami, Janai Purnima, Krishna Astami, Gaijatra, Dashain, Tihar, Losar, Chite Dashain, and Ghode Jatra. These long-established celebrations are regarded as a byproduct of Nepali culture.
                                    

<h3>The Major Festivals, Celebrations and Jatras Celebrated in Nepal</h3>

<p>In Nepal, there are residents from many castes, languages, and faiths. People of various racial and religious backgrounds have a wide variety of traditions and behaviors. The following is a discussion of the main Jatras, festivals, and celebrations observed in Nepal:</p>

<h2><strong>Dashain:</strong></h2>

<p>Dashain is regarded as one of the national festivals of Nepal. The Dashain festival is recognized in the Hindu community as a celebration of the triumph of truth over falsehood. The tradition of celebrating the Dashain festival is thought to have started in order to commemorate Ram&#39;s victory over Ravana, the symbol of sin, and mark the triumph of good over evil. The defeat of Maisashur by Mata Durga Bhavani is said to be celebrated as a magnificent festival, according to a second statement made in connection with the start of the Dashain festival. The destruction of the Mahisasur monster from Mata Durga Bhavani has also been seen as the triumph of justice and truth over injustice.</p>

<p>This celebration lasts for ten days in the month of Ashwin, and as Dashami is given special significance, it can be presumed that the name Dashain will continue. Ghatasthapana, or the first day of Dashain, is so named. From Ashwin Sukla Pratipada (Ghatasthapana) to Dashmi, Mata Durga Bhavani is worshipped specifically during this festival. The destruction of the Mahisasur monster from Mata Durga Bhavani has also been seen as the triumph of justice and truth over injustice. There is a history of offering sacrifices not only at Shakti Peethas/temples but also in homes, particularly on the days of Saptami, Ashtami, and Navami. Nine days are dedicated to nine different types of goddess worship.</p>

<p>Tika&#39;s day is Vijay Dasami. It is traditional to accept the Prashad of Bhagwati on that day, as well as Tika, Jamara, and the senior members&#39; blessings. During this wonderful event, family members who left their homes to go to work would come back to collect Tika from their loved ones. During this holiday, family get together under the pretense of putting Tika. As a result, Badadashain has become a festival celebrated in Nepal as well, encouraging family peace by encouraging visits to relatives and friends.</p>

<p>When the hot weather and rainy season are over, this celebration takes place in the lovely autumn season. The Kathmandu Valley also hosts a variety of classical dances and Jatras throughout this event. At this event, Bhaktapur witnesses the Navadurga dance while Kathmandu participates in the Pachali Bhairav jatra. Similar to this, every evening from Navaratri to Bijayadashami, Ashtamatrika dance (Gampakh) is performed in Patan&#39;s central square. During this event, it is customary to worship, sing, and dance while erecting Durga Bhavani idols throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>One of the greatest holidays observed nationally is Dashain. The army of the Nepalese establishment does puja on Ghatasthapana during this occasion. Hanumandhoka, Kathmandu, celebrates Fulpati on the day of Saptami. It is customary to travel to Nuwakot&#39;s Dhunibesi to worship the Bel tree and to select the Belpatra needed for this particular day to be brought as Fulpati. The Brahmins who bring the Fulpati choose those who reside close to Ranipokhari in this manner. Then, in Hanumandhoka, the leaders of the constitutional bodies, ministers, and government employees congregate. They travel to Ranipokhari to take Fulpati while dancing and listening to Bandbaja and Panchebaja. Fulpati is treated with royal deference and grandeur when he is brought to Hanumandhoka while being confined in a hammock. It is usual for the occasion for the. On the occasion, it is customary for the king to worship the flower but with the establishment of republicanism, president does this nowadays. Likewise, on the tenth day, the soldiers dressed in old military dress move playing the ancient musical instruments of warfare, and a man carrying a sword as a royal representative walk ahead around the Hanumandhok durbar. It is called Khadga Jatra.</p>

<h2><strong>Tihar:</strong></h2>

<p>The celebration takes place in the month of Kartik, right after Badadashain. The event, which lasts for five days starting on Kartik Krishna Triyodashi, is a celebration of sibling love and well wishes. In connection with the occasions when Yamuna served him and revered him, Yamaraj spent these five days with his sister Yamuna, which is also known as Yamapanchak. Yamaraj&#39;s connection to the festival is revealed through the popular folklore surrounding the celebration&#39;s beginnings. In remembrance of Yamaraj, people keep their homes and courtyards tidy during this holiday. The event is thought to have started with the ideal that no one should die tragically, prematurely, or by accident. This festival, which is the second largest festival in Nepal, has been established as a festive gathering of brothers and sisters. Deepawali is the main characteristics of Tihar which is celebrated for five days.</p>

<p>On the final day of this event, Bhai Puja is held, and cows, dogs, Lakshmi, and cattle are also worshipped. The crow is revered as a Yamraj messenger on the first day of the celebration. Dogs are revered as Yamdut and human defenders on the second day of the celebration. It is usual to give the dog special food and a garland on that day. Gaitihar is observed on the festival&#39;s third day. The flickering bulb in your home is being lit by the cow. based on the notion that Lakshmi was not adored or alive that morning. At night, Lakshmi is worshipped. On the day of Lakshmi Puja, it is traditional to burn incandescent lamps, candles, and luminous lamps as well as to enter the house without lamps. Ploughman (bull) Tihar is the festival&#39;s fourth day. Bulls and the Govardhan Mountains are worshipped on that day. The cattle that work all year round for the people, pulling the cart and plow the land, have a day off on Hali Tihar.</p>

<p>By creating the mountain and watching over the animals there, Lord Krishna is thought to have started the tradition of worshipping Govardhan as a representation of the protection of the people of Vrindaban. The Nepal Samvat new year starts on the same day. So, on that day, the Newar community performs Ma Pooja and brings out the pilgrims to celebrate the New Year. Bhaitika falls on the festival&#39;s final day. On that day, brothers and sisters exchange Tikas, or wishes for happiness, wealth, and longevity, and sweets in proportion to their respective abilities. Brothers also offer their sisters gifts in proportion to their respective abilities. The males play Deusi while the women perform Lakshmi Puja on the evening of Hali Tihar.</p>

<p>The celebration honors brotherly compassion and harmony among distant siblings and brothers while also celebrating human relationships, love and harmony with animals. Kauda is a celebration when games like dice and cards are played. It&#39;s unclear where it all began. However, during the Rana dynasty, the drummer used to announce that everything except the family, the wife, and the kids might be gambled. During the time of the Rana, there used to be gambling in every corner of Dilli Bazaar, which is now known as Charkhala in front of the Sadar Jail complex. This has had a very negative effect on society, and as a result, such sports are today prohibited by law.</p>

<h2><strong>Buddha Jayanti:</strong></h2>

<p>On Baisakha Purnima in 563 BC, Siddhartha Gautam Buddha was born in Lumbini, Nepal. He was the offspring of Kapilavastu&#39;s King Suddhodhana. Tilaurakot is now the name of that location. Even though he was a prince, the opulence of the palace did not make him at ease. He was concerned on the causes of illness, aging, and death. At the age of 29, he eventually went away from the palace in quest of the truth, leaving his wife Yashodhara, son Rahul, and aspiration of becoming king behind. This process is known as &quot;great demarcation&quot; in Buddhism. He left his house on Baisakh Purnima as well.</p>

<p>The birth of the Buddha in 563 BC on Baisakh Shukla Purnima, his enlightenment on that same day in 453 BC, and his attainment of Nirvana on that particular day are all commemorated as &quot;Buddha Jayanti&quot; holidays across the nation. Huge gatherings occur on this day in Buddhist Gumba, Bihar, and monasteries. Nepal declares this day a national holiday, and a number of events are planned to examine the Buddha&#39;s teachings, including his message of peace. Monks engage in rituals such as Dharmadeshana, Buddha Puja, Shill, and prayer. Buddhist pilgrims travel to Lumbini, the birthplace of the Buddha, Bodhgaya, the site of his learning, Sarnath, the site of his first attempt at knowledge proclamation, and Kushinagar, the site of his attainment of Mahaparinirvana, on that day, to pay homage to Buddha.</p>

<p>Scholars from the nation and beyond discuss Buddhist knowledge on the anniversary of Buddha&#39;s birth in Nepal, the country where the Buddha was born. The majority of pilgrims to the revered Buddhist pilgrimage site Lumbini come from Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Thailand, but there are also significant numbers from China, Japan, Korea, and India. In Lumbini, a sizable ritual is held on the day of Buddha Jayanti. It is common for nuns, monks, devotees, worshipers, and spectators to gather around Lumbini with the statue of the Lord Buddha and conduct musical performances. On the festival of Buddha Jayanti, a unique event is also celebrated in Swabhumunath, Kathmandu. Buddhist rituals, Buddha Mantras, and dances depicting various Buddha postures are carried out on that occasion. Likewise, it is a tradition to revolve the city by placing a statue of Buddha in a specially decorated Khat/ carriage from the Hiranyavarna Mahavihar in Lalitpur on the occasion of the birth of Buddha. In that Jatra, the instrumentalists, chanters, hymns, and incense burners are at the forefront.</p>

<p>The eighth iteration of Bishnu, according to Hindu texts, is Buddha. Even the Hindu religious people celebrate and pay honor to Buddha on the anniversary of his birth. Buddha is regarded as the architect of global peace. As a result, there are several ways to celebrate Buddha Jayanti in Nepal. But it appears that the genuine meaning of commemorating the birth of Buddha can only be understood and used if we carefully consider the teachings of the Buddha, the image of peace, and meditate on them.</p>

<h2><strong>Lohsar:</strong></h2>

<p>According to the Tibetan calendar, the Lohsar festival, which falls in the month of Magh, is a notable occasion for the Sherpa, Bhote, Gurung, Tamang, Thakali, and Magar tribes in Nepal&#39;s Northern Himalayan area. The Lohsar of various races take place on various days between Poush and Falgun. But for those who observe it, Lohsar appears to fall on the same day every three to four years. Every 12 years, the year is determined using the names of various animals, including rats, cows, tigers, cats, eagles, snakes, horses, sheep, monkeys, birds, dogs, and pigs. Like Hindus&#39; Dashain, the Himalayan population celebrates Lohsar as a great holiday. Among the most important holidays observed in the Himalayan region are Sonam, Tamu, and Galbo Lhasar.</p>

<p>It is customary to gather up with friends, family, and well-wishers during this event, which is also known as the New Year, and exchange presents and pleasantries. The celebrations involve adorning the house and the courtyard, preparing different foods, attending worship services, dancing, and mingling with others.</p>

<p>From the final two days of the Tibetan calendar through the third day of the new year, the celebration is typically observed. On the first of the final two days of the previous year, an unique dish called Kuthuk&mdash;made by combining several grains&mdash;is consumed. It is customary to conduct worship in the courtyard the following day after cleaning. Chhemar, a special dish made with rice, butter, and sugar, is accepted as an offering after worship.&nbsp;On New Year&#39;s Day, it is customary to send greetings and gifts to friends, neighbors, family members, and other family members. Various meals prepared from Chhyang, Desil (a type of casserole), juice, various types of liquor, fruits, and Khapse&mdash;a dish created from a combination of flour, ghee, and sugar&mdash;are traditionally carried in exchange for this kind of greeting. It is usual for ladies to place flour on their left knee and for males to place money as Dakshina on their right shoulders when carrying this gift. Similar to how each celebration changes with time, Lohsar has likewise been regarded in a variety of ways as a happy and joyous festival. The New Year&#39;s celebration and the Old Year&#39;s departure, however, are really its main attractions.</p>

<h2><strong>Eid:</strong></h2>

<p>Islam is thought to have been founded by the Prophet Mohammad, who was born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. A &quot;Muslim&quot; is a person who adheres to Islam. Islam enthusiastically observes Eid. The two holidays of Eid and Bakr, sometimes known as Bakr Eid, are observed by Muslims in Nepal and by Muslims worldwide. Eid is observed during the entire Hijri calendar month of Ramadan. They control the power of the senses during the first month of Hazrat Samvat&#39;s new year, and during the Ramadan fast, they celebrate Id Ul Fitra on the last day of the current month and the first day of the following month. They exchanged good wishes for the new year and said Eid Mubarak in the interim. Those with the means donate to the less fortunate on this holy festival so that they can take part in the festivities. They &quot;donate&quot; or &quot;zakat&quot; half of their riches to the poor and take care of their basic needs. The celebration includes reading prayers, reciting verses from the Quran, and offering animal sacrifices.</p>

<p><br />
Every day of the Eid fast is spent in prayer. It is usual to observe fasting on the day of Id Ul Fitra. According to Hazrat Samvat, the Bakar Eid or &quot;Id Ul Zuha&quot; feast is celebrated on the tenth day of the month of Zillahila, which is two and a half months after Eid. On that day, it is usual for pious Muslims to offer sacrifices of goats, sheep, etc. Halal refers to the practice of butchering animals from the base of the neck. When making animal sacrifices, they separate the flesh into three halves, keeping one for themselves, one for friends and neighbors, and one for the less fortunate.</p>

<h3><strong>Who was Hazrat Ibrahim? There is a statement about him in Muslim belief:</strong></h3>

<p>Ibrahim the Hazrat was a follower of Allah. One day, Allah appeared to him in a dream and requested that he make sacrifices or offer up his most prized possessions. He also starts the process of offering his most cherished son as a sacrifice to Allah by blinding him by wrapping a cloth over his eyes. Allah approved of this. When Ibrahim opened his eyes, he discovered that although his son was still alive, a goat had been killed. Since that time, Bakar Eid has become a holiday.</p>

<h2><strong>Chhat Festival:</strong></h2>

<p>The Humans, who have always worshipped the natural world, may have honored the sun from the very beginning. Despite the advancement of human civilisation, all cultures and religions have treated the sun with respect. The Chhat festival is also a unique celebration that is celebrated with ritual worship.

The devotees visit over 300 Sagar, Kunda, Pokhari on that day, including the Ganga Sagar, Dhanus Sagar, Ratna Sagar, Agnikund, Bihar Kunda, and Papamochani Kunda of Janakpur.

<p>The Chhat celebration often starts with prayers offered to the setting sun in the evening and finishes with devotion and prayers offered to the rising sun the following day. In the past, people have prayed during the Chhath celebration for the sun to fall into the lake and river. People gain the self-assurance to pursue their ambitions by reverently worshiping the sun in this way. Some of the devotees crawl with their breasts to the rivers or ponds to finish their fast in order to fulfill their vows. During the Chhat celebration, numerous different worship conventions are followed. During this event, holiness is highly valued. It is customary to fast and worship the day before it gets dark, then to worship and finish the fast the following day after daybreak. This event has been observed throughout the past few years not just in Nepal&#39;s eastern Tarai but also in the valley&#39;s reservoirs. The Chhath festival has recently been held in the valley and other locations. With the movement of people, their religion and culture are moving as well as spreading in such religious communities.

<h2><strong>Mother&#39;s Day /Matatirtha Aunsi:</strong></h2>

<p>There are a number of unique holidays that are associated with the memory of mothers and the excellence of the nation among the many festivals that are observed annually in Nepal. The most well-known celebrations in Nepal are Mother&#39;s Day, Matri Aaunshi, and Mata Tirtha Aaunshi, which are all observed on Baisakha Krishna Aaunshi. On this day, people recall the mother&#39;s essential traits, draw inspiration from them, and express their respect and loyalty to them. Since ancient times, this event has been observed to honor the woman who gave birth. Children should congratulate their mother on eating sweets with reverence and respect on this day. It is considered that the blessings bestowed by the mother who is happy with this job would have a significant impact. On this day, those without mothers should visit Matatirtha in Kathmandu or another pilgrimage site and offer Sidha and Pinda. The children are said to experience enormous success as a result of the blessings the departed mother bestowed via that work.</p>

<h2><strong>Kushe Aunsi:</strong></h2>

<p>Every year, on the day of Bhadra Kushe Aaunshi, Kushe Aunsi falls. On this day, it is acknowledged that cutting the Kush, which Brahmins must always have for their ceremonial ceremonies, after finishing their worship with the Mantra is beneficial for the community as a whole. As a result, the festival&#39;s name, Kushe Aunsi, is derived from the name of the Kush. Due to the fact that Kush is used in religious rituals, Kush holds a significant amount of significance in the everlasting religion. No religious practice, including the worship of God and ancestors, is carried out without Kush. Only when the sacred Kush is worn as a Pabitra or held in the hands is piety and deity worship accomplished. Kush was created at the same time as the&nbsp;origin of Brahmaji.</p>

<p>As a result, Indra and other Gods were observed utilizing Pabitra of Kush during worship, fasting, and penance, according to the Puranas. As powerful as Indra&#39;s Bagra, Narayan&#39;s Sudarshan Chakra, and Lord Shankar&#39;s Trishul is the liar clutching the Kush-holy/Pabitra. In order to save the earth, God took the form of Baraha, destroyed the Hiranyakshya monster, and then walked to the ocean beach to relieve his tiredness. The Lord&#39;s hairs that had fallen while he was sleeping there later developed into Kush and Kaash. So it is thought that God Baraha is where the Kush context came from. Similar to how Brinda cursed Lord Bishnu in Swastani&#39;s story, declaring that he must be grass, causing Lord Bishnu to change into Kush. It is a classical belief that Kush, which is associated with God, should not only be used in the religious rites, but also required for Karta, Acharya to become pure, safe and strong, to make Pabitra of Kush, to sit in the seat of Kush, Sandhya Bandan only by taking Kushdanda and to perform all religious acts.</p>

<p>It is usual for the father to make blessings requests and offer culinary items he enjoys with great reverence on this day. Those without fathers carry out Shraddas, offerings, and ritualistic ceremonies in their absence; they also give food to the priests as a representation of their father. While performing Shraddha, charity, and virtue is another special aspect for the peace of the deceased parents, it is the children&#39;s special duty to serve their parents during their lifetime. The kids are responsible for carrying out both of these tasks. These acts shouldn&#39;t be hypocritical, blasphemous, or defiling. Virtue is the general term for all such actions. On this date, patriarchal rituals are also performed at Gokarna in Kathmandu, Barahakshetra of Sunsari and in the pilgrimages sites like Devghat, Bishnupaduka. Also people keep new Kush in their home on this day.</p>

<h2>Socio-economic Status and Its Influence in Health</h2>

<p>People have embraced their own culture for years or even centuries. Although Nepal has a rich cultural heritage, its citizens have a dismal economic situation. Health and disease-related cultural customs vary throughout Nepal&#39;s many communities. In Nepal, people practice taking a morning bath, worshiping and praying to God, singing psalms, and having a strong religious belief. This maintains our mental wellness while also being physically clean, fresh, and refined. It is not common practice in our culture to enter the kitchen wearing shoes that would shield the food from contamination. Consuming ghee, Kwanti, yam, and Chaku during Maghesakranti is a custom used to warm the body on chilly days.</p>

<p>On Ashar 15th, eating curd and chewed rice is also healthy and helps to support the digestive system. Oil massages performed on freshly delivered mothers and babies while they are exposed to the sun are also good for their health. This aids in the mother and child&#39;s body strengthening and vitamin D synthesis. But it&#39;s crucial to be aware that spending a lot of time in the sun can be harmful. In order to keep the new mother healthy and ensure that the infant receives adequate milk, she is fed ghee, Chaku, thyme juices, and meat. All of these social actions are accepted as being healthy and beneficial.</p>

<p>Green vegetables and other vegetables are cleaned after cutting in various localities in our nation, causing the nutrients to be lost. Use of smoking stoves has a negative impact on health. Due to the superstition that a patient with diarrhea should not drink any water, this condition can result in death. Similar to eating a lot of stale meat, eating a lot of meat during Dashain and other celebrations might be unhealthy. In celebrations and gatherings, members of the Matwali caste consume alcohol, cigarettes, and beer. Additionally, from a health perspective, this is not ideal.</p>

<p>A person&#39;s access to all essential facets of health, education, communication, and nutrition will grow and increase when they are financially successful. Polygamy, prejudice against daughters and sons, excessive festival spending, and borrowing money when one does not have it are all practices that contribute to poverty in Nepalese society. Economically underprivileged communities are unable to get even basic necessities since they are constantly engaged in living their lives. As a result, people who adhere to the orthodox tradition without acquiring health information, thoughts, or consciousness adopt unscientific and unhealthy habits. Poverty causes acute malnutrition, a lack of food intake, and a lack of a balanced diet. In this way the social and economic condition of any society seems to play an important role in improving the health and infection of various diseases of the people there.</p>

<h2>Factors Affecting Nepal&#39;s Economy</h2>

<p>The structured system of methods, resources, services, and tangible goods is known as the economy. Due to a lack of funding and other resources, Nepal has not been able to advance swiftly in many fields. As a developing nation, Nepal&#39;s government strives to make the nation successful and wealthy through quick economic development. The current issues include poverty, a low per capita income, inequality, intense pressure on agriculture, a lack of capital, unemployment, a large reliance on the export of primary commodities, low productivity, and political instability brought on by recent years. As a result, the following issues are covered in relation to Nepal&#39;s economic development:</p>

<h3><strong>a. Poverty:</strong></h3>

<p>One of the main challenges to Nepal&#39;s economic development is poverty. To reduce poverty and address the issues it causes, a significant portion of the nation&#39;s income must be spent. Due to a lack of funding, development is severely hampered in this way. Poverty typically refers to social and economic regressivity. Being in a state of poverty means you lack the proper ownership, control, and access to the resources you need to maintain a minimal standard of living. This condition also leaves you psychologically, socially, and economically handicapped.</p>

<p><strong>Causes of Poverty:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Targeted program is not effective and a poorly targeted program,</li>
	<li>Unequal distribution of agricultural land, excessive dependence on agriculture and low productivity,</li>
	<li>Fragmentation of land,</li>
	<li>Due to low economic growth rate,</li>
	<li>Don&#39;t have a good social security system,</li>
	<li>Discrimination and inequality,</li>
	<li>Structural weakness of the economy, narrow production base, low productivity,</li>
	<li>Weak governance,</li>
	<li>Due to poor policy and weak distribution system,</li>
	<li>High population growth rate,</li>
	<li>Increasing unemployment,</li>
	<li>Political instability,</li>
	<li>Weak security situation, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Poverty is basically measured and analyzed in two ways: absolute poverty and relative poverty.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Absolute poverty:</strong> A person is considered to be in absolute poverty if they are unable to meet their fundamental needs, including those for clothing, food, housing, general healthcare, education, and housing. Absolute poverty, according to the Copenhagen Declaration, is characterized by extreme deprivation of essential human needs such food, safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health, housing, education, and information. It depends both on access to social services and income. Extreme poverty is a slang word frequently used to refer to &quot;absolute destitution.&quot;

	<ul>
		<li>The purchasing power parity is the basis for the World Bank&#39;s assessment of absolute poverty. The poverty line, according to the World Bank, is currently set at an income of less than US$1.25 per day.</li>
		<li>The absolute minimum standard of living is not as bad as poverty.</li>
		<li>If absolute poverty rises, overall poverty rises as well, and vice versa.</li>
		<li>It calls for programs to extend fundamental services like those for hunger, malnutrition, education, and clean water for health.</li>
		<li>It is survival.</li>
		<li>The achievement of the fundamental minimal needs is prioritized.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Relative poverty:</strong> Comparative poverty is another name for relative poverty. By comparing one person to another and one person to another in terms of how poor another person is, poverty is always measured. A nation, a caste, or a society maintains a specific level of consumption based on the circumstances at a particular moment. Relative poverty is defined as consumption below that threshold. It is calculated using the Gini coefficient, Theil index, and Income inequality matrices. The degree of relative poverty varies among nations, eras, situations, classes, and societies.
	<ul>
		<li>Compared to the social classes of the lower and higher classes.</li>
		<li>If relative poverty is reduced, overall poverty might not go down.</li>
		<li>There is a need for initiatives to better the social, economic, and political situation.</li>
		<li>The focus is on socialism founded on rights and emotional respect.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>b. Inequality:</strong></h3>

<p>Along with poverty, Nepal also has an unequal distribution of wealth. Development and construction projects will not be completed, and poverty and inequality will persist until the poor people who are confused in the dark environment due to illiteracy and poverty are lifted out of it.</p>

<h3><strong>c. Population Growth:</strong></h3>

<p>Economically underdeveloped nations are found to have high rates of population growth. Countries with rapid population growth see an increase in poverty. The economic side of things is crucial in enhancing peoples&#39; quality of life. A high quality of life is associated with fewer children being born. Similar to this, having additional children is not necessary to improve the financial status of the family if income is high. The national economy will be directly impacted if people&#39;s economic activities including employment, income, business, production, and investment do not increase but merely see an increase in population. Changes in population have impacted labor force, productivity, and consumption because it is a primary source of labor force.</p>

<h3><strong>d. Unemployment:</strong></h3>

<p>Unemployment is one of the situations when the majority of people lack the ability to work, despite their desire to do so, according to the means of production. Unemployment is the state in which a person finds themselves despite having the desire, the will, and the qualifications to find job.</p>

<p>The phrase &quot;unemployed&quot; denotes &quot;living a life without labor and spending leisure lavishly,&quot; according to the Advanced Nepali Dictionary.</p>

<p>Along with the country&#39;s growing population, unemployment is a barrier to Nepal&#39;s economic growth. The economy of Nepal appears to have also been impacted by the semi-employed and invisible unemployed. When a person does not land a full-time job, they are considered to be in semi-employment. Semi-employment is defined as working 5&ndash;6 months out of the year and being jobless the remaining time. The individual in question is prepared to work, but they are unable to find employment year-round due to a lack of opportunities. What appears to be employment from the outside is known as invisible unemployment; nevertheless, not all people who are employed may be referred to as employers.</p>

<p><strong>Types of unemployment:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Open unemployment: W</strong>anting to work but no any opportunities.</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible unemployment: </strong>Invisible unemployment means that even though it looks like employment from the outside, it is not a job for everyone who is employed. If a small percentage of people are excluded from a production operation, the total output is not affected, then it is called invisible unemployment. Such poverty is in the rural area of the country.</li>
	<li><strong>Minor (semi) unemployment: </strong>Daily, weekly, seasonal work.</li>
	<li><strong>Seasonal unemployment: </strong>Getting work at the time of harvesting and plantinf and remaining unemployed the rest of the time.</li>
	<li><strong>Educated unemployment: </strong>Not getting work according to qualification though educated.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Reasons for unemployment in Nepal:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Subsistence agricultural economy,</li>
	<li>Rapid growth of the population,</li>
	<li>Lack of professional/ vocational education system (faulty education),</li>
	<li>Slow industrial development,</li>
	<li>Weak rural development,</li>
	<li>Due to general poverty, lack of employment promotion programs,</li>
	<li>Lack of long term employment policy etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>e. Miscellaneous inequalities:</strong>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Nepal is an island nation. The geographical disparity in this area has had a significant effect on Nepal&#39;s economy. The development of Nepal&#39;s economy is additionally hampered by issues such as gender inequality, corruption, political unrest, complicated service flows, and competition in the design and implementation of programs that are more focused on delivery than on production.</p>

<h2>Major Health Problems Among Different Ethnicity</h2>

<p>The National Census of 2068 states that there are only 125 castes in Nepal. Each of the three castes has its own traditions, celebrations, morals, ceremonies, and civilizations. Different cultures, traditions, and rituals from various castes that have been followed for a long time are accepted in Nepal. The primary causes of disease in different Nepalese villages and cities are thought to be due to deities&#39; wrath, the lack of deity worship, demons, the valiant Masan, witchcraft, etc. Numerous minor and serious health issues plague Nepal&#39;s major tribes as well as the entire nation. The following are the primary health issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Prevalence of Infectious Diseases: </strong>

	<ul>
		<li>In our rural society, the prevalence of communicable diseases has increased because of ignorance, illiteracy, superstition, and social traditions. On the other hand, epidemics of infectious diseases like dysentery, cholera, and Myadey fever are being spread by a lack of clean water, environmental pollution, and safe drinking water.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>High Infant Mortality: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Nepal is one of the nations with a high infant mortality rate. According to current estimates, 32 out of every 1000 live births occur in Nepal. Various tribes&#39; superstitions and medical customs contribute to a high infant death rate. The high newborn death rate could indicate that both the mother and the child are not receiving adequate medical treatment.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>High Maternal Mortality: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Maternal mortality is a sign that people in the country, especially those who are marginalized in general, lack access to health services and facilities. Maternal mortality rates in Nepal have decreased somewhat, although many rural women are said to have passed away due to complications with their wombs and pregnancies.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Malnutrition: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Inadequate access to healthcare, widespread poverty, ignorance, social traditions, the spread of infectious diseases, and a lack of nutrition in our culture are all contributing factors to the prevalence of malnutrition, which is particularly prevalent in children and pregnant women. The growth of youngsters is hampered by malnutrition. The growth of youngsters is hampered by malnutrition. Because of malnutrition, infant and child mortality rates are high in our community.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Sexual and Reproductive Health Problems:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Many diverse societies are reluctant to discuss sex-related and reproductive illnesses in public and refuse to seek treatment. Hiding sexually transmitted diseases in this way just complicates the matter. As a result of the practice of polygamy and polyandry in particular castes in Nepal, STDs are more likely to be transmitted. Sexually transmitted illnesses like gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV/AIDS are common among sex workers and those engaged in commercial sex and can be spread through unsanitary sexual contact.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Chronic Diseases:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Every ethnic group has its unique culture. Similar to Gurung, Magar Rai and Limbu prioritize drinking during celebrations. As a result, persons who live in areas where smoking and drinking are common are more prone to develop chronic conditions including asthma, high&nbsp;blood pressure.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Lack of Health Care: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>In our nation, there are far fewer facilities and healthcare options than there are people. The demand for healthcare services has not increased in line with population growth. Uneven distribution of doctors, hospitals, and people (Per hospital and per doctor the population is high). Health care of a high caliber is not accessible due to a lack of resources and infrastructure.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Lack of Health Education: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>People in Nepal experience disease as a result of a lack of health education. In rural life, it is common to believe in Dhami, Jhankri, God, and goddesses, to treat one another with pledges, and to reject the scientific method. In Nepal, these conventional beliefs have caused a serious health issue.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Population Growth:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The increased population expansion in Nepal has had a negative impact on the availability of food, safe drinking water, healthcare, and services. Population growth is becoming recognized as a health issue.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Environmental pollution: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>In Nepal, environmental degradation has increased along with population growth. Due to environmental contamination, a number of ailments are become more common.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Health Seeking Behavior and Care Practices Among Major Castes/Ethnicity</h2>

<p>There are roughly 125 ethnic groups coexisting with the native culture in our nation. Each caste&#39;s culture has both beneficial and detrimental effects on its health. Health is impacted directly or indirectly by traditions based on such cultures, superstitions, customs, practices, food habits, rites, beliefs, Jatra, fairs, religious tendencies, etc. Below, this link is covered in more detail:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Causes of Disease: </strong>

	<ul>
		<li>People once thought that illnesses would be brought on by the wrath of ghosts, Masan, demons, and God&#39;s curses, as well as by famine, tragic accidents, and mental disturbances. People in nations like ours, where superstitious beliefs are common and health education is lacking, believe that diseases are mostly brought on by God&#39;s wrath, ghosts, the evil eye, the Masan, the cold or the heat, etc. Rural residents frequently think that disease or illness is the result of sins committed in a previous life, a ghost, or a deity&#39;s curse.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Prevention:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>People still choose to receive medical attention from Dhami, Jhankari, Lama, etc. in some rural communities.</li>
		<li>Some cultures think that praising gods is an excellent way to treat illness.</li>
		<li>Despite the fact that humans are susceptible to disease, Jharfuk, Homan, Yagya, etc., many people believe that religious rituals will prevent and control illnesses..</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Treatment and Health-Related Behaviors and Practices: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>When it comes to receiving healthcare, the cultures of those who reside in various communities can have an impact and vary based on those cultures. For example, some people believe that if any physical effects (illness), the problem was caused by ghosts, and Masan and the Dharmi-Jhankari provide water mixed with ashes, worship Naag believing it to be the source of the problem, provide water of broom, provide Buti Jantar, etc. People who live in the community have created their own understanding of illness as a part of their culture in this way. The following describes how members of various ethnicities and cultures behave and adopt both good and bad health habits:</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Healthy/Positive (Good) Discovery Behaviours and Practices:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>To prevent toothache, brush your teeth daily with twigs of Neem.</li>
	<li>Rinse the sore throat with salt, ginger and turmeric with boiling water.</li>
	<li>Eat raw garlic while burning or indigestion.</li>
	<li>When you suffer from cold, drink lukewarm water, rinse or dilute in boiling water with salt turmeric and lemon.</li>
	<li>Drinking more water when having urinary disorders, eating tomatoes with sugar or taking Ghodtapre (Mediicinal herb) with sugar.</li>
	<li>Use Aloe Vera or sink in water if the person has burnt.</li>
	<li>To cure eye problems, heat using hot rice in a cloth or radish leaves.</li>
	<li>The newborn baby and the newly pregnant mother is massaged with oil in the sun. When you suffer from fever, feed the leaves of Neem and use wet clothes as a band (Panipatti).</li>
	<li>From the point of view of health, it is advisable to provide the soup of Carom to the other after the childbirth.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Negative (false) Health Behaviors and Practices:</strong></h2>

<p>Here are some of the health problems related to particular cultures and ethnicities of our country and wrong behavoiurs in treatment:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Go to Dhami, Jhankri to treat your tooth believing that they can remove the germs of teeth.</li>
	<li>Smelling shoes when a person with epilepsy suffers from fainting.</li>
	<li>Do not let to drink water during diarrhea.</li>
	<li>Do not undergo vasectomy because of the misconception that the person don&#39;t not go to heaven if done.</li>
	<li>Applying soil or cow dung in a wound.</li>
	<li>Pregnant women go to Dhami, Jharfuke instead of going to the hospital when are unable to have a baby.</li>
	<li>Force Jharfuke to extract the poison of serpents.</li>
	<li>Offer sacrifice and put vow considering the cause of mental illness is due to the anger of deity.</li>
	<li>Cutting of the newborn baby&#39;s placenta with unsterilized tools.</li>
	<li>People with sexually transmitted diseases have the illusion that having sex with a virgin girl can treat the disease.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Language</h2>

<p>The use of language is the primary means of emotional expression. It serves as a forum for idea exchange in human society. Nepal has many different languages. All mother languages spoken in Nepal are recognized as the national language by the constitution. Here, residents of many ethnicities converse in their native tongues with their families and neighbors. The most common language is Nepali. The official language of the nation is Nepali. The language of communication is Nepali. All Nepalis are able to communicate in Nepali. In prehistoric Nepal, Kirat, Sanskrit, and Pali were spoken, and Bramhi, Sirijangha, Devanagari, Ranjana, and other scripts were developing. The development of Sanskrit language in the latter half is found to be much more in line with that of other languages.</p>

<p>Following the ascent of Jayasthi Malla, the writing of the Newari language began in the Middle Ages. There were other additional languages spoken in Nepal at the time, but they were not recorded in writing. Since the arrival of Muslim traders, Urdu and Persian were widely spoken during the Middle Ages. Sanskrit, Maithili, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Awadhi, and Parbatey (Nepalese) language experts were present in the palace, according to history.</p>

<p>In Nepal, 123 languages are used as first languages, according to the census taken in 2068 B.S. The majority of Nepalese people speak Nepali, Maithili, Bhojpuri, Tharu, Tamang, Nepa, Bazika, Magar, Dotel, etc. as their mother tongues. In Nepal, 44.6 percent of the people speak Nepali while 11.7 percent Maithili, 6 percent Bhojpuri, 5.1 percent Tharu, 3.2 percent Tamang, 3.2 percent Newari, 3 percent Banjika, 3 percent Magar, 3 percentage Dotli and Urdu is spoken by 2.6 percent people.</p>

<p><strong>Development and Extension of Nepali Language</strong></p>

<p>On the basis of linguistic archeological characteristics and political developments, the development of Nepali language is divided into the following three periods:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Primary phase:</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Ancient time is found to be from 1040 B.S to 1549 B.S. As proof of this, the inscription of Dumupal of 1038 B.S is taken.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Medieval Stage:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>When we examine the language&#39;s evolution from the Carobarik Bivosh Shahi&#39;s Model written by Dhvakarmath in 1555 B.S., the language model of Motiram in his life and character of Bhanubhakta in 1948, the language of the &quot;Hasyakadamba&quot; of Shakti Ballabh in 1855, and more, we discover that the Nepali language has demonstrated its vividness when it came from ancient times to medieval period and</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Modern phase: </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The Gorkhapatra&#39;s publication in 1958 marks the beginning of the Nepali language&#39;s modern era, which continues to this day. During this time, Gorkhapatra and numerous other periodicals contributed significantly to the language&#39;s development. Newspapers like Sundari (1963) and Madhavi (1965) made immeasurable contributions to the growth and dissemination of the Nepali language. A unique part has been played in the purity of Nepali language by the Halanta rejection movement of Rammani and his people, Sharada Magazine (1991), and Jharrabadi Movement (2013). The Jharrabadi movement has given particular importance to using precise Nepali vocabulary in order to give the language life, vibrancy, and strength.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Language Family</h3>

<p>The languages of the globe have been divided into various families by linguists. The following language families can be used to study the many languages spoken in Nepal:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Indo-European/Aryan Family:</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>The most populous and extensive language family is Indo-European. It has been referred to as Indo-European because it makes up the majority of both the Indian subcontinent and Europe. The language family that is the most common and extensively spoken in major parts of Europe and Asia, and whose members can nearly always be found anywhere in the globe, has dominated every field, including literature, civilization, culture, knowledge, science, politics, and so on. The most successful areas of study have also been in languages. Sanskrit, English, Abesta, Greek, Latin, Russian, German, and other rich and ancient world languages are members of this family. Scholars hold varying opinions about the Indian language family&#39;s nomenclature. It appears that different names, such as Indo-Germanic, Indo-European, Indo-Hittite, and Aryan families, have been assigned by scholars. Despite having a different name, it has become more well-known due to the Indo-European language family. The origin of the Indian language family is still a matter of debate. An estimated 4500 years ago, members of the Indo-European language family coexisted and spoke the same language.</li>
		<li>The majority of people in Nepal speak one of the several languages in this family. The Indo-European family language is present in Nepal because of the Aryans. In this family, people speak languages like Nepali, Maithili, Bhojpuri, Awadhi, Tharu, Rajanshi, Danwari, Majhi, Bote, Darai, Kumal, Churetti, Madwari, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Dravidian family:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>A race is the Dravidians. The Dravidian language family still includes the dialects used by the Dravidian caste. The majority of countries that speak members of this family of languages include Malaysia, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Burma, and East and South Africa. The primary tongue of this family, which has been in this dialect for more than 1500 years, is Tamil. Languages like Tamil, Sentamil, Malayalam, Kannada, Telugu, Kolami, etc. are members of this family. Yoga is one of the primary characteristics of the Dravidian language group. There are two different number types and three genders in this language family, although passive voice is not supported. With a predisposition for acoustic sounds, this family of languages tends to utilize the vowel term more frequently. The suffixes assigned to the languages in this family are to be utilized for the separation function. Additionally, the Dravidian family is distinguished by the usage of a sufficient number of adopted terms together with the nominal words &quot;male&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; to indicate gender. People from Jhangad speak this family of languages in Nepal. The language is known as Jhangad.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Tibet-Burmese or Chino-Tibetan Family:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>In terms of speakers, the Chino-Tibetan family is the second biggest linguistic group after the Indo-European group. Bangladesh, Thailand, Nepal, Bhutan, Vietnam, and other countries also speak the language, which is mostly spoken in China, Tibet, and Burma. Scholars categorize the family into the Bhote-Burmese and Thai-Chinese classes. Tamang (Murmi), Newari, Magar, Rai, Kiranti, Gurung, Limbu, Sherpa, Chepang, Sunuwar, Thami, Dhimal, Tibetan, and Jirel are just a few of the many members of this family that are spoken in Nepal. The following are the main linguistic characteristics of this family:
		<ul>
			<li>Has no prefix and suffix.</li>
			<li>Single word language.</li>
			<li>The language in which the position of word defines the meaning of the word.</li>
			<li>Language that can be discriminated through Tan.</li>
			<li>The language with the majority of nasal sounds.</li>
			<li>Languages with different symbols for different words.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Aagnya Family:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The Austriac language family and Agnesiya/Agnali are other names for the Aagnya language family. The language family, which is primarily located in Southeast Asia, stretches from Nicobar Island to Annam, Cambodia, Burma, Thailand, and India. The Sattar / Santhal language is spoken by the Sattar people in Nepal.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Single Language Family:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The language that does not belong to any language family in the globe has been grouped together by experts under a single language family. The Kusunda language, used by the Kusunda people, is a member of this family.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

	<ul>
		<li>The family of Bhot-Burmese or Chino-Tibetan languages includes the Sherpa language. Sherpa language is the name of the native tongue of the Sherpa people. Tibetan script is used to write the Sherpa language. This script is utilized for a variety of writings, including Buddhist education, Tantric science, and religious instruction. From sarwa/ya, the word sherpa appears to have developed. In Tibetan, &quot;Sar&quot; denotes the east while &quot;Wa&quot; or &quot;Ya&quot; denotes a person. People who originated in the East are referred to as sherpas. In Nepal, mountain climbers are known as Sherpas, and they are concentrated in the Himalayan areas. Solukhumbu is the major destination for them. They also reside in the hilly regions of Manang, Mustang, and Humla. The ethnicity of Sherpas is well known throughout the world. The amount of literature written in this language is incredibly low. Despite having a very small population of speakers, this language is regarded as being crucial to Nepal. Sherpa language speakers make up 0.43 percent of Nepal&#39;s total population, according to the census taken in 2068 B.S.</li>
