                                    <h2>Definition of Method</h2>

<p>Various writers have given different definitions of method of Health education.</p>

<ul>
	<li>According to J. E. Avent: &quot;Methods are the procedures by which a goal is reached, a purpose accomplished or a result achieved.&quot;</li>
	<li>&quot;The teacher&#39;s way, which causes behavioral change in pupils.&quot; - Lardisbal and Friends.</li>
	<li>&quot;Method is the way or path followed in imparting knowledge with the aim of securing the best possible educational result.&quot; - Bhatia and Bhatia.</li>
	<li>In the conclusion, we can say - &quot;Methods are the means through which a teacher organize and guide the teaching experience for the optimal achievement of educational goal.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Classification of Methods:</h2>

<p>Methods of health education are techniques or ways in which series of activities are carried to communicate ideas, information and develop necessary attitudes and skills. Mainly methods have been classified into three groups according to the number of people willing to get health education. out
                                    

<ul>
	<li>Individual Methods</li>
	<li>Group Method</li>
	<li>Mass Method<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Individual Methods</h3>

<p>This method involves person-to-person or face- to-face communication which provides maximum opportunity for two-way flow of ideas, knowledge &amp; information. Adequate interaction between the health educator &amp; his client help provide health education successfully resulting in attitude &amp; expected behavioural change&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>We can discuss, argue &amp; persuade the individual to change his behaviour.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantage</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The numbers we reach are small &amp; health education is given only to those who come in contact with us.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Types of individual method:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Counseling</li>
	<li>&nbsp;Interview</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interview</h3>

<p>It is a method of providing health education through the means of questions &amp; answers between the health educator &amp; the learner. In this process interviewee&#39;s knowledge, attitude, feeling &amp; health practices are studied, &amp; essential suggestions are given to bring about the positive change. The interview has been defined as a &quot;talk with a purpose.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Purposes</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>To secure information by face to face contact</li>
	<li>To identify attitude, personality &amp; behaviour of interviewee.</li>
	<li>To gain confidence about interviewee</li>
	<li>To collect personal data</li>
	<li>To make hypothesis</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Types of Interview</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Planned or structured or formal interview:</li>
</ul>

<p>This interview is organized &amp; preplanned. Questionnaire is used as the tool of interview, which contains a set of predetermined questions, which are structured in a written form. Along the collection of information &amp; data, some relevant health teaching could also be done.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Spontaneous or unstructured or informal interview:</li>
</ul>

<p>In this interview no predetermined questions are asked. The interviewer collects the information by free discussion on existing health problems. Here, questions will be spontaneous based on the faced problems.</p>

<p>Qualities of interview questions</p>

<ul>
	<li>It should be valid &amp; reasonable.</li>
	<li>It should be simple, understandable unambiguous.</li>
	<li>Respondents will be expected to know the answer.</li>
	<li>It should be culturally acceptable &amp; should not be offensive.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Process of interview</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Setting the time &amp; place for the interview:</li>
</ul>

<p>An adequate amount of time should be set aside for the interview. The length depending on the purpose &amp; nature of interview judgment must be exercised on both the length of time allotted for the interview &amp; the time at which it takes place if a person is seriously ill &amp; may new &amp; frightening thing; are happening to him or if he has just been admitted to the hospital &amp; is having numerous tests &amp; examinations. It may be best to delay in interview until the immediate crisis is over. Again if the person appears to be becoming fatigued, it is wise to terminate an interview &amp; complete the passion at another time. Interviews should be scheduled for a time when both the patient &amp; the nurse are free from other commitments.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Interview</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Gain adequate knowledge &amp; information on the topic.</li>
	<li>Develop the questionnaire to collect information.</li>
	<li>Inform the interviewee about the interview &amp; other necessary arrangements.</li>
	<li>Decide the place &amp; time of interview.</li>
	<li>Decide the target group or individual.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Beginning the Interview</strong></p>

<p>An interview is especially a conversation between two people often as when the patient has just been admitted to the agency &amp; the nurse has not met him before between two strangers. The nurse as the interviewers has a responsibility to put the other person at ease. For the beginning student, who is perhaps a bit apprehension about interviewing someone it is helpful to remember that the patient, too is probably anxious. Most people who seek the help of health professionals by coming to a health agency either ill or in some way concerned about their health. Even those who are well &amp; attending health maintenances clinics usually have some minor worries. They are all, therefore at least a little anxious. It helps if the nurse observes the common courtesies of calling people by name, offering them a seat or offering their permission to slide down &amp; fall. The nurse should also introduce herself by name. These courtesies convey a feeling of respect for he person. The common ritual also helps the urses to feel more comfortable.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Establish proper rapport to gain interviewee&#39;s confidence &amp; put him/her at ease. It can be done by greeting &amp; giving self-introduction to the interviewee before putting actual question of questionnaire.</li>
	<li>State the purpose &amp; importance of interview. Convince about the interviewee&#39;s responsibility to get good response.</li>
	<li>Ask the questions in polite manner. Listen to the interviewee &amp; make sure that he/she has understood the questions.</li>
	<li>Do not laugh or shout rudely or any negative comments during interview.</li>
	<li>Provide enough time to think &amp; respond.</li>
	<li>Avoid disturbing activities like talking with other person during interview.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eliciting Specific Informat</strong></p>

<p>Although the nurse often has specific information that she want to obtain from the individual during the interview it should not be conducted as question &amp; answer session. It may be structured interview in the sense that the nurse controls &amp; directs the conversation. When the nurse gathers information in her assessment interview, but individual should feel free to discuss his feeling &amp; concern &amp; the thing that are important to him. Most people will give all the information needed, &amp; more, if an open climate is created.</p>

<p>In this regard the section in chapter on creating a climate in which the patient feel free to communicate &amp; on learning to listen will be helpful.</p>

<p>When there is specific information that the nurse would like to obtain some direct question will have to be asked. In such cases it is probably a good idea to start with the person&#39;s immediate concern that is his feeling &amp; perception in regard to whatever the interview is about withoutinterjecting too many questions in the beginning.</p>

<h2>Group Methods</h2>

<p>Our society contains groups of many kinds- school children, mothers, industrial workers, patients etc. Group teaching is an effective way of educating the community. The choice of subject in group health teaching is very important; it must relate directly to the interest of the group. For example, we should not begin discussion of the subject of tuberculosis control to a mother who has come for delivery; we should talk to her about child- birth &amp; baby care. Similarly, school children may be taught about oral hygiene; tuberculosis patients about tuberculosis; and industrial workers about accidents. We have to select also the suitable method of health education including including audio-visual aids for successful group health education.</p>

<h3>Small Group Discussion</h3>

<p>The most appropriate number for discussion is 4- 8 but 10-12 members can also take part in the discussion. In a group discussion, there should be a facilitator. (A recorder may be appointed if any findings, view or decision need to be recorded or presented to a plenary session).</p>

	<li>An observer: May be used to watch the process. He sits away from the group where s/he sees what is going on but he does not participate in the discussion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pattern of Communication</strong></p>

<h2>Problem Solving/Problem Based&nbsp;learning (PBL)</h2>

<p>It provides opportunity to the students for analyzing and solving a problem on the basis of the previous stock of their knowledge enriched with the present means available to them, quite independently by following some systematic steps and arriving at some basic conclusion or results to be utilized in future for the solution of the similar problem in identical situations.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>

<ul>
	<li>To encourage critical thinking by the learners.</li>
	<li>To allow students to extend their knowledge and keep it up to date in their future profession.</li>
	<li>To provide knowledge in such a way that it is better retained and applied more easily in later professional practice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Principles of Learning as Applied in PBL</h3>

<ul>
	<li>PBL typically involves students working on problems in small groups of 5-12 with the assistance of a faculty tutor.</li>
	<li>Problem serves as the context for new learning.</li>
	<li>Their analysis and resolution result in the acquisition of knowledge and problem solving skills.</li>
	<li>Problems are encountered before all relevant knowledge has been acquired.</li>
	<li>Students generate questions about what kind of knowledge is required to explain the mechanism underlying the cause of the problem.</li>
	<li>Significant time is available for independent study.</li>
	<li>PBL process is completed when students report in next meeting.</li>
	<li>The student&#39;s first goal is to relate newly acquired knowledge to the problem at hand.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advantages</h3>

<ul>
	<li>People develop creative thinking and learning.</li>
	<li>People can develop the skill of solving problems.</li>
	<li>People are expected to research the problem themselves and solve them.</li>
	<li>They feel confident in facing the problems.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disadvantages</h3>

<ul>
	<li>It is difficult to utilize problem-solving strategy for deriving specific educational purposes.</li>
	<li>Problem-solving strategy requires independent efforts on the part of participants to find out the solution of the problems. It requires proper patience, abilities and capacities.</li>
	<li>Takes a longer time.</li>
	<li>Needs different types of resources to solve the problems</li>
	<li>It may not prove useful for all because of different people&#39;s ability.</li>
	<li>If the teacher does not give adequate supervision, wrong solutions to the problem may be made.</li>
</ul>
