                                    <h2>Society</h2>

<p>The word &quot;society&quot; is English. The Latin term &quot;Socius,&quot; which signifies companionship and sociability, is the source of the English word &quot;society.&quot; It makes clear how social ties are related to the term &quot;society.&quot;</p>

<p>In general, society entails that we comprehend the demographic we immediately encounter as well as the design of their living arrangements. The term of society is widely used, and it encompasses many different levels and facets of people, organizations, groups, etc. The society is basically made up of the relationships, activities, and interactions between different groups. Individuals, groups, and communities within a society are interconnected and related to one another. They participate in each other&#39;s activities and responses. The society also has other elements like conflict, competitiveness, and cooperation.Therefore, society is a web of social connections. Society emphasizes a dimension of belonging within it in addition to just a framework. People in a society naturally rely on one another at all levels, from the family to the community to the state. Nobody is flawless in and of themselves. Human activity is meant to accomplish something because of this dependence. These actions and procedures undergo various changes over time. In this way, a person&#39;s behavior is influenced by the society&#39;s values, beliefs, customs, etc. IThese ideas help a person become more clear-cut, structured, and goal-oriented in their behavior and actions. A group of people cannot be considered a single civilisation. A group of individuals gathered at a fair or at a bus stop cannot be regarded as a society. Being a society
                                    

<ul>
	<li>A number of persons</li>
	<li>Geographical boundary or limit</li>
	<li>It is necessary to have a similar culture.</li>
</ul>

<p>A group of individuals that share a common environment, behavior patterns, and way of life is referred to as a society. The inhabitants in the civilization do, however, differ greatly from one another. For instance, the inhabitants of the Himalayan region are very different from other people, and western and eastern societies also differ from one another. We can accept any nation as a contemporary society. such as the societies in Nepal, India, the United States, etc.</p>

<p>Different scholars have offered different definitions of society. Below are a few of them:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>According to Giddings</strong>

	<ul>
		<li><em>&quot;Society is the union itself, the organization, sum of formal relations in which associating individuals are bound together&quot;.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Maciver and Page&nbsp;</strong>
	<ul>
		<li><em>&quot;Society is the web of social relationship&quot;.</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Society is a network of ties between people rather than merely a collection of individuals. A society is a system of relationships and interactions between various structural components. All of the Tharu societies, urban Tharu societies, developed Tharu societies, civilized Tharu societies, underdeveloped Tharu societies, etc., are the societies that we are familiar with. But for sociological anthropologists to understand these civilizations, there must be interactions, interdependence, and linkages among their constituent parts on every scale.</p>

<h3>Fundamental Essential Factors of the Society</h3>

<p>The fundamental components of society are listed below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>People.</li>
	<li>Relationships, interactions, and competitiveness among one other.</li>
	<li>Conduct.</li>
	<li>Value, custom, and acceptance in society.</li>
	<li>A social divide</li>
	<li>Control.</li>
	<li>Mental states, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Characteristics of Society</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Society is immaterial and unseen, but it is immortal and can be felt.</li>
	<li>The idea of society is dynamic.</li>
	<li>It is impossible to envisage a civilization without people.</li>
	<li>Different societal units are interdependent on one another.</li>
	<li>Both commonalities and differences underlie society.</li>
	<li>In society, there is both collaboration and conflict.</li>
	<li>Society&#39;s culture is an essential component.</li>
	<li>The members of the society are aware of one another.</li>
	<li>The society has a system in place to manage social interactions, activities, conflicts, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Culture</h2>

<p>The Sanskrit term is where the word &quot;culture&quot; originates. According to this perspective, the word &quot;culture&quot; is meant to be polished, meaning that it is connected to a factor that can refine an individual. Some sociologists claim that the word &quot;culture&quot; is derived from &quot;Sanskar,&quot; which means &quot;pure action,&quot; and that it refers to the components that go into creating a social being.</p>

<p>The Nepalese Brihyat Dictionary states that culture has traditionally been linked to indigenous, ideological, and traditional contexts over a long period of time, as well as groups of beliefs, emotions, thoughts, meditations, and physical manifestations that distinguish the shape of a nation, society, caste, etc. through ethical thought, tolerance, etc.</p>

<p>The totality of knowledge, belief, morals, art, religion, language, values, and physical characteristics is what is generally referred to as culture. It comes from the human brain as a byproduct. As a result, various cultures can be found in various societies. Culture encompasses both tangible and abstract features that were created by humans and is passed down from one generation to the next.</p>

<p>The culture has been defined in various ways by various scholars.</p>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>According to E.B. Tyler </strong></em>

	<ul>
		<li><em>&quot;Culture is the complex whole which includes knowledge, belief and morals, law cultural and other capabilities acquired by </em>a man as a member of society.&quot;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><em><strong>According to M. J Harshkonit</strong></em>
	<ul>
		<li><em>&quot;Culture is part of the environment created by man.</em>&quot;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><em><strong>According to B. Malinowsky </strong></em>
	<ul>
		<li><em>&quot;Culture is the work and means of a human being, through which he achieves his goals.&quot;</em></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>These concepts demonstrate how culture is a complicated and wide-ranging topic that cannot be adequately described by a single definition. It is acknowledged as a member of the community. Culture includes all societal norms, values, and practices that have been created by humans, including the arts, literature, and rules.</p>

<h3>Elements of Culture</h3>

<p>The components of culture can be studied in the following two sections:</p>

<p><strong>Physical Culture</strong></p>

<p>For example, Pati, Pauwa, temples, weapons, materials, homes, statues, machines, etc. are examples of physical culture. Physical culture also refers to material culture or concrete objects.</p>

<p><strong>Intangible Culture</strong></p>

<p>Though generated by humans, intangible/non-physical cultures are those that cannot be immediately experienced or touched, such as ideas, religions, philosophies, and scientific theories. Traditions, conventions, values, beliefs, superstitions, religious practices, social ties, and other aspects of a culture influence how the disease is perceived to have originated and how treatments are chosen. These are what their own group considers to be cultural traits. The following are examples of intangible cultural elements:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Faith/ Belief</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Faith is having confidence in something. believing in God, believing in ghosts, believing that babies or children are subject to evil glances from sterile women, and believing that these glances can even result in the infant&#39;s death. Change is challenging.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Values</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Values are the tenets that members of the community have adopted, voluntarily or not. Such perceptions may be favorable or unfavorable. Honesty, help, friendliness, and tendency are examples of values. Sons are prioritized over daughters, for instance, in Nepal. Priorities for Jharphuk/Witchdoctors are an example of this.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Attitudes</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The way you see something or someone is their attitude. It grows as a result of a subject&#39;s or person&#39;s knowledge, experience, and beliefs. The notion that having children is a gift from God contributes to unfavorable opinions about family planning.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Social Boundary</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>A social boundary is an action that is socially unacceptable and cannot be performed. A person who does this gets penalized. For instance, Brahmins are socially forbidden from eating eggs, poultry, onions, mice, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Superstition</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>A blind acceptance of something without any scientific support might be characterized as superstition. Superstitions include, but are not limited to, the refusal of water during diarrhea, the use of dung or clay in place of cuttings, and the sick going to the priest, the lama, the dhami, or the jhankari for treatment.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Customs</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Customs are accepted social norms that describe how members of a community go about their daily lives and have been passed down from one generation to the next for many years. Examples of such practices include receiving Tika from elders during Dashain, performing Gupha and Belbibaha in the Newari community prior to menstruation, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Tradition</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The transmission of conventions, norms, values, beliefs, and other traditions from one generation to the next has been going on for a while. For instance, Hindus practice cremation while Muslims and Christians bury their dead in cemeteries. In Brahmin and Chhetri culture, couples do not get married with the same surname. Tradition includes things like celebrating several holidays.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Religious Behaviours</strong>
	<ul>

<h3>Characteristics of Cultures</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Man has created culture.</li>
	<li>Culture is an acquired habit.</li>
	<li>Transfer of culture occurs.</li>
	<li>A culture can change.</li>
	<li>The ideal is culture.</li>
	<li>There are various cultural types.</li>
	<li>Culture is transmitted through language.</li>
	<li>The people&#39;s needs are met in part by culture.</li>
	<li>Culture has symbols.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Importance and Relationship of Society and Culture</h3>

<p>The type of socialization that occurs depends on the culture that a person was raised in. Each of which contains all the traits developed by the individual, such as faith, moral principles, art, language, and tradition. Every society has its own distinct culture, which is the accumulated knowledge of the heritage and conduct taught. As a result, every community&#39;s culture affects the attitudes and actions of all demographic groups, including children, young and old people, women, and others. Both positive and bad consequences on their health may result from such practices. Healthy behavior is taught by good, scientific culture, and it also contributes to people&#39;s health.</p>

<p>Human needs give rise to culture. A culture aids in accommodating people&#39;s demands as well as the passage of time. The understanding of how human society has evolved and the formation of helpful citizens in youngsters are both crucial for society. Maintaining a culture of love, empathy, and brotherly bonds is important to both society and culture. Social studies also serve a crucial role in resolving social disputes that result from scientific surroundings, developing broad viewpoints, tolerance, and self-control, and producing decent citizens for both the country and the world. People become ethical, disciplined, responsible to society, self-critical, and wise citizens as a result of their culture. As a result, society and culture are fundamental to human existence and are as much a part of us as skin and blood. Without culture, society is still insufficient, and vice versa.</p>

<h3>Art and Culture and Its Effects on Health</h3>

<p>The term &quot;art&quot; is defined as &quot;the skill, ability, skill of accomplishing any work, etc.&quot; in the Nepali Comprehensive Dictionary, which is reported to contain sixty-four practical arts. Architecture, idols, paintings, music, literature, and other forms of fine art are also regarded as arts. Art is the practice of doing any task well. All forms of creative expression&mdash;poetry, short tales, dance, painting, building a house, sculpting, creating music&mdash;are categorized as arts.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Fine Arts</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Fine art is regarded as the best genre among the numerous arts. Painting, sculpture, architecture, and music are all examples of fine art. To imply that society is reflected through art. Similar to how a mirror reflects our faces, art captures the truth of modern civilization. Art is the primary reason that Nepal is regarded as having a rich cultural product. All that is being done right now is to protect it and update it to meet modern standards. The development of the fine arts is thought to have reached its peak during the medieval era. The four distinct categories of Nepali art are architecture, painting, sculpture, and woodcraft.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Ancient Fine Arts (Beginning to 937 B.S.)</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>In prehistoric times, human beings lived in caves. They wrote on stones with stones to make pictures, especially in the vicinity of the place being empowered by the power of the Divine. Sculpture and architecture were well established from ancient times, and in the middle ages, it developed to its extreme boundaries. The fact that Nepal was regarded as a rich country since ancient times is justified by the mention of the word &quot;Archa&quot; in the ancient record of Lele of 526 B.S. &#39;Archa&#39; means an organization for meeting and discussion of artists.It has played an important role in the development of the art. In Nepali society, the art created in ancient times can be divided into as follows:</li>
		<li><strong>Architecture</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Like painting and sculpture, architecture is one of the most stunning and well-known forms of great art. Architecture is the process of creating different types of palaces, temples, Patis, Pauwas, and other structures that are symbols of beauty. Since the beginning of time, this kind of exquisite art has been produced. According to several stone inscriptions and Chinese traveler&#39;s writings, the Managriha, Kailaskut Bhawan, and Bhadradhivas temples were among the best of their era. We can use the historic Changunarayan temple as an example. Construction materials utilized at the time to build homes, temples, palaces, and monasteries included wood, bricks, tiles, and stones. Even the roofs of some temples and palaces were constructed using metal sheets. The following styles of architecture were particularly popular in antiquity.
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Pagoda style</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Pagoda style refers to multi-story buildings with tiled roofs that are shaped like shingles, such as homes and temples. This type of roof is regarded as the foundation of Nepali architecture. Nyatpole, Changunarayan Temple, Managriha, Bhadradhivas Durbar, Kailaskuta Bhavan, and Pashupati Temple are a few examples of this style of old building.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features of This Structure</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>In the courtyard of the temple, artistic items.</li>
	<li>A particular kind of sanctuary.</li>
	<li>The roof&#39;s several layers Use of Arch and Tundal.</li>
	<li>Interesting use of wood and brick.</li>
	<li>The center of the temple, which is hollow.</li>
	<li>These temples are lavishly ornamented.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Chaitya Style/Stupa</strong></p>

<p>The bones of Lord Buddha, the precursor of peace, are enclosed in a stupa, a monument with a wider and larger womb and a semi-circular shape. It has the appearance of a Buddha begging pot turned upside down. Nepalese stupas, monasteries, and bihars are all prime examples of Chaitya architecture. The four Patan Ashoka stupas, the old Swayambhu statue, and the Chaitya Temple in Bahl may all be considered examples of early Chaitya architecture. The collective residence, the monastery, and the courtyard were all built in the Chaitya style for the Buddhist monks and nuns.</p>

<p><strong>Painting</strong></p>

<p>Since painting serves as the foundation for both sculpture and building, it may be claimed that painting has existed since antiquity. Paintings from the past cannot be used as examples today since they are made specifically out of Bhojpatra, palms, fabrics, and paper, and they quickly degrade. However, it may be deduced from ancient inscriptions and paintings on Belbutt, fish, cows, Kalas, lotuses, kettledrums, Chakras, Trishul, conch, and other objects that painting had already started in ancient times. The Chinese visitor claimed that the Managriha, Kailashkut Bhavan, and Bhadraniwash had diverse murals painted on their walls. However, as these structures vanished, the old paintings also vanished. The Bodhisattva, which is believed to be ancient, was painted on a hill close to Tundaldevi, the famous city of lined painting.</p>

<p><strong>Features of Ancient Painting</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Spiritual.</li>
	<li>Symbolic.</li>
	<li>Sentimentality.</li>
	<li>Anonymity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sculptures</strong></p>

<p>One of the significant works of fine art is sculpture. The creation of idols has a long history. Making idols of famous figures such as Gods and Goddesses out of materials including clay, stone, metal, and wood was common practice in antiquity. Oil and earth were combined to create a variety of idols. Terracotta is the name for this kind of technology. The Terakota statues have been preserved in the National Museum in the same condition that they were discovered during the excavation of Lumbini, Hadigon, and Dhumbarahi because they are as sturdy as stones. The early Lichhivi period statue of Uma Maheshwar is a superb illustration of terracotta technology. The statue of Kiranteshwar Mahadev, erected next to the Pashupati by King Yalumbar, and the statue of Virupaksha of Aryaghat are two examples of sculptures from the Kirant era. Idols from the Lichchivic era seem to have been influenced by sophisticated religion. Examples of such outstanding sculptures include the Vishnu Vikrant statue from Lajimpat in 520 B.S., the Vishnu statue from Budhanilantha&#39;s reservoir, the Bara idol from Dhumbarahi, and the Changunarayan eagle&#39;s image. It is clear from the fact that Bhrikuti accepted metal Buddha idols as dowry in her marriage. The metal statues Ratomachindranath and Meenanath are two examples.</p>

<h3>Medieval Fine Arts (From 937 to 1825 B.S.)</h3>

<p>Arts were established during this time due to the love of art among medieval kings and competition between three valley-based kings. Due to the dedication and fortitude of the Nepalese people, as well as the training of the professors who fled from India&#39;s Vikramasil and Nalanda schools as a result of the Muslim Empire&#39;s invasion, the architectural structures constructed in the Middle Ages have been extraordinarily attracted by carving various idols. Nepal is today recognized as a nation with a diverse culture as a result.</p>

<p>The medieval era is regarded as the &quot;golden age&quot; of metal art, and it was during this time that the metal artist Araniko gained recognition in China. The insane Bhairav idol of Pashupatinath created during the reign of Jayasthati Malla, the statues of Pratap Malla in front of Hanuman Dhoka, King Yogendra in front of Patan Taluje, and King Bhupathindra Mall of Bhaktapur are examples of metallic art. The usage of various attire and adornment is particularly common in medieval idols, which contributes to their stunning appearance.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Architecture</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Despite the fact that architecture was practiced in antiquity, no outstanding examples can be found today. As a result, the medieval period is regarded as the golden age of fine art due to the development of numerous forms of aesthetic architecture in various architectural styles. The temples are built in the classic Pogada fashion. Currently, these temples exist as a result of our culture. Some excellent examples include the Kathmandu Valley&#39;s Taleju Bhavani Temple, the Patan Kumbeshwar Temple, the Singha Temple, the Panchtale Temple in Bhaktapur, the Dattatreya Temple, and the Baagh Bhairav Temple in Kirtipur. By erecting numerous structures in Tibet and China that were designed after pagodas, the artist Araniko throughout the Middle Ages became well-known internationally. Examples of medieval Chaitya architecture include Bauddhanath and Swayambhu.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Pinnacle style</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The contour of the mountain range can be compared to this peak style, which is considered a new kind of medieval art. Roofless pinnacle style is referred to as a snowless summit that tapers upward. An outstanding example of the medieval peak style is the Radhakrishna Temple of Patan, which was constructed by Raj Siddinarasingh and is located close to Patan Sundhara and Bhaktapur Batsalya Devi.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features of This Style</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Typically, build a temple at the pinnacle of a hill.</li>
	<li>A single Mandap was constructed in front of the temple.</li>
	<li>Setting up a circular route.</li>
	<li>possesses lighting fixtures</li>
	<li>In the temple, place a statue of the primary deity.</li>
	<li>Limit the number of floors.</li>
	<li>Without feeling the necessity for roofing in the temple, the summit&#39;s roof.</li>
	<li>Make the summit rising upwards and tapering.</li>
	<li>Use various chariots.</li>
	<li>Imagine a Saptarath, Pancharath, and Trirath.</li>
	<li>Pinnacle and umbrella usage</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Bihar style</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Bihar style refers to the architecture of the homes surrounding the shrine. The old Bihar fashion can be compared to Maan Bihar and Raj Bihar. In the Middle Ages, people regarded the monastery&#39;s imposing temples to be extraordinarily beautiful. There are 137 monasteries in the Patan district, 120 in Kathmandu, and 24 in Bhaktapur, the most of any district in Nepal.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Mixed style</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The Janaki Temple at Janakpur, which was began in 1895 and finished 12 years later by King Pratap Singh and Queen Vrishbhanukumari of Tikamgarh, India, is an illustration of mixed architectural style. This style combines Rajput and Mughal elements, or Shikhar and Gumbaz.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Painting</strong></p>

<p>Chinese explorers claimed that paintings were used to embellish the palaces of the Lichhivi monarchs, and scholars have asserted that India&#39;s painting influences can be seen in Nepal&#39;s origins. Artifacts of ancient paintings are scarce since they were typically painted on materials like wood, fabric, Tadpatra, and paper, all of which quickly degrade. Since the Middle Ages, Nepali painting has undergone a tremendous evolution. Nepali artists created book paintings, wall paintings, and scroll paintings throughout this time. After the Nalanda and Vikramashish Schools in India were destroyed by the Muslim conquest, numerous artists from Nepal sought the assistance of those academics, which inspired them to establish this style of painting. The two most notable examples of medieval painting are &quot;Pragyapramita,&quot; a painting based on Buddhism, and &quot;Bishwashtantra,&quot; a book painting based on Shaivism, both from the eleventh century. People put snake paintings on doors during Nag Panchami, while the Newar tribes used to place pictures of Ashtamangal, Kalash, Netrambrahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Ganesh, Kumar, Suga, and Panchabuddha on doors during wedding ceremonies. Paintings from the Middle Ages often depict ignorance and calm. The following three aspects of ancient and medieval paintings can be studied: Red was used for rage scenes, yellow for spectacular scenes, blue for horror scenes, and black for ways.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Wall Painting</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>The practice of painting with white limes on the walls of the home while combining them with black lime, cow manure, linen, etc., was becoming more and more common. These wall decorations can be seen on the walls of old temples, palaces, and monasteries. Safes can still be seen in the Bhaktapur 55 window palace and the Kathmandu Kumari House.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Book Painting</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The 900-year-old Buddhist writings that show Buddhist artwork are the ancestors of Nepalese painting. Hindu deities are less frequently depicted in texts than Buddhist deities are. These texts are strikingly close to Ajanta and Ellora&#39;s Indian style. Many Mahayana and Tantrayana literature include diverse paintings on paper, wood, Taadpatra (palm leaf), and bojpatra (tree bark). There are two categories for this kind of image:</li>
		<li><strong>Patra Painting</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>On the front or either side of the book&#39;s original text are various paintings.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Gata Painting</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Various paintings created outside of the book on wooden planks.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Scroll Painting</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>A scroll painting is an image created on paper or cloth and intended to hang on the wall. Two techniques were used to create this type of image:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Mandala Picture</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>The deity&#39;s image is created on cloth and paper for religious work as a tantric and symbolic image in the center of the circle. using the &quot;circle&quot; technique in the center of the canvas The section contains images that are tantric or symbolic.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Pata</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>The practice of hanging various images made of cloth and paper that are as long as 5 to 6 meters and are based on myths about gods and goddesses was developed in the eighteenth century. The deity&#39;s image is positioned in the middle of the &quot;pata&quot; method, and the other deities are positioned all around it.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Medieval Painting</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Variety.</li>
	<li>Classics.</li>
	<li>Religious righteousness.</li>
	<li>Fantasy.</li>
	<li>Originality.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Sculptures</strong></p>

<p>The golden age is still considered to be a medieval era from an aesthetic perspective despite the political unrest. Ancient sculpture appears to have evolved significantly during the medieval era. Many damaged sculptures from that era have been discovered due to the destruction of many Hindu and Buddhist idols in the valley during the invasion of the Samsuddin of Bengal in the fourth century. The monarchs of those cities competed to create idols following the political split in the Kathmandu Valley, which resulted in historically extraordinary advancements in sculpture. King Siddinar Singh of Patan, King Pratap Malla of Kathmandu, and King Bhupathindra Malla of Bhaktapur are significant figures in this regard.</p>

<p>The Krishna temple in Mangal Bazar and several idols based on the Mahabharata of Thama&#39;s narrative are great examples of the artistic stone sculptures that emerged throughout the medieval era. The Patan king Siddinarsingh Malla deserves praise. The human-shaped Chaturmukhi sculpture created during the reign of King Jayasthi Malla, the Ugrachandi Bhagwati built during the reign of King Bhupindra Malla of Bhaktapur, the Mahisapur Madini, and the Bhairav statue created during the reign of King Pratap Malla of Kathmandu, are examples of medieval stone statues from the period.</p>

<p>The sculptures of medieval Nepal were rich, made of wood, metal, and stone. The copper and iron covering sparked the sculptures and gave them durability. Particularly in the Kathmandu Valley can be seen statues carved by the talented Kaligardh. In general, stone, wood, and metal sculptures in Nepal have reached great levels of development. Though less developed, soil (terracotta) sculptures are highly lovely. Popular idols include the Umameshwor idol of Kwahaha, the Surya idol of Thapahiti, the Narasimha idol of Changun, the Sridhar Vishnu idol of Changunarayan, the Chaturmukhi Linga of Deupatan, the Bishnu Behewa of Patan Kumbhashowr, and the Vishnu idol of the National Sculpture of Pashupatinath built during Stithi Malla Famous Chaturmukhi sculptures include the human-shaped Nrityashwor Idol (National Museum).</p>

<p><strong>Features of Medieval Sculpture</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Selection of brittle, rough stone.</li>
	<li>Create a long, narrow face.</li>
	<li>Excessive jewelry use</li>
	<li>Create a beautiful halo.</li>
	<li>Give the idol some ventilation.</li>
	<li>Use a unique kind of mask.</li>
	<li>No effective control over body ratio.</li>
	<li>Place the double pedestal near the sidewalk.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modern Fine Art (From 1825 to present time)</h3>

<p>Although the arts initially retained their originality following Nepal&#39;s unification, foreign imitation continued to rise during the Rana period, and after 2007 B.S., the perception of art progressively changed, leading to an overabundance of foreign style at the moment. Many artists were eventually born, and numerous projects relating to art education were launched.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Prithvi Narayan Shah started building architecture after the creation of modern Nepal. He built Nuwakot Palace, and later Bahadur Shah built the Shiva Parbati Temple in Basantapur, the Jagannath Mandir in front of the Sadar Jail, the Shiva Mandir in Tripureshwor by Lalit Tripura Sundari, the Baagh Durbar by Bhimsen Durbar, and other structures. Following Jung Bahadur&#39;s trip to Europe, Western architecture began to emerge in Nepal. The Thapathali palace was first constructed in the Western architectural style by Jang Bahadur.&nbsp;Following this, many palaces in the western style were constructed by Rana kings and their kin. The Singha Durbar, Lal Durbar, Seto Durbar, Babar Mahal, and Kesar Mahal are a few examples of this style of construction. A new skill, style, approach, and medium in architecture started to be established after the Rana era. Artistic homes were replaced by modern construction. Our architecture has been influenced by foreign style as a result of studying architecture overseas. Currently constructed homes are all of foreign design.The majority of dwellings are not of Nepali style. The creation of regulations protects historical sites such temples, Patis, Bihars, monasteries, and palace grounds that have been designated by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites. For the sake of preserving Nepalese architecture, it is imperative that dwellings be constructed as closely as possible in Nepali style. When passing home maps, village officials and municipalities appear to pay attention to Nepali style.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Painting</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Paintings by Prithvi Narayan Shah, Ran Bahadur Shah, Rajendra Bikram Shah, Bhimsen Thapa, and others from this era serve as illustrations of the Vishnu Purana, Markandeya Purana, Madhukaitav, and other ancient texts. A new painting style was created during Jang Bahadur Rana&#39;s travels to Europe with the help of a painter named Bhajuman who had instruction in the UK. Through the use of oil painting, shading, and lighting, he pioneered a new practice of portraying a person with both eyes visible. Following Bhajuman, Chandraman Maske and Tej Bahadur Chitrakar achieved great fame for their paintings depicting hunting or Sikar. In order to advance the institution of painting, Nepal Art School was founded in 1991. The Archaeological Arts Protection Act was created in 2013. Soon after that, in 2014, the Academy was founded and the Indra Rajya Lakshmi Award was organized. The College of Fine Arts was founded in the year 2024, and in the following year, 2030, it underwent a transformation to become a campus for the fine arts. The Kala Mandap was created in Lalitpur, and the Art Society was founded in Kathmandu. Similar to how galleries like Birendra Art Gallery, Park Gallery, Palpasa Art Gallery, and Skibb 71 are fostering the growth of realistic art, comics, and satirical paintings in the modern style.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Features of Modern Painting</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Creativity</li>
	<li>Variety</li>
	<li>Traditionalism</li>
	<li>Life Relativity</li>
	<li>Relevancy</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Sculpture</strong></p>

<p>The statues of Prithvi Narayan Shah and his two queens were once thought to be examples of early modern sculpture that had been influenced by the Middle Ages. The Swet Murti, the statue of Lalit Tripura Sundari in front of the Tripureshwar Shiva temple, the Vishwaroop idol with 1000 hands built by Jagat Jung in Pashupatinath, and the Basaha / bull statue of Pashupati founded by Jagatjung can all be seen as excellent examples of metal sculptures created during the reign of Ran Bahadur Shah. In response to the development of the western sculpture style during Jang Bahadur&#39;s journey to Britain, Rana created their own statue in the position of a climbing horse. This has recently been positioned in Tundikhel&#39;s four corners. In Kathmandu&#39;s Martyr Gate, the sculptor Ratna Bahadur Tuladhar erected a statue depicting four martyrs and King Tribhuvan. Balakrishna Sama and Amar Chitrakar created the statue of Prithvi Narayan Shah in front of Singh Durbar Gate and the soldier idols at Kathmandu&#39;s Sainik Maanch among other concrete style idols. Examples of these statues can be found outside the offices of the Agricultural Development Bank, Nepal&#39;s Air Service Corporation, and Kathmandu.</p>

<h3>Nepalese Wood Arts</h3>

<p>There are no Lichhivi wood arts available. However, at that time, monasteries, temples, and palaces all used wood. In the subject of wood art, the medieval era saw variety and artistry. Nearly all of the temples constructed during this time have various Sculptures put in the Tundals.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Windows and Doors</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Monuments all around the valley have wooden decorative windows in a variety of shapes. Excellent examples of woodwork artwork are the windows in Mayur, Desemaru, Kumari House, 55 Window Palace, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Tundal</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Since the Early Middle Ages, wooden objects have been discovered. Early medieval woodwork can be seen in the tundals from Patan from the 12th and 13th centuries, Chhadrabarga Mahbir in Salvajika mudra, the 11th-century tundal from Itumavahal in Kathmandu, the tundal from the 12th and 13th-century Panauti Indreshwar Temple, etc. Excellent examples of woodwork may be seen in tundals, which are employed in structures like medieval Pagoda-style temples. A tundal is a piece of plain or decorative wood that is positioned at a 45-degree angle to support the monument&#39;s roof.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Arcade</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Semi-circular arches at the entrance can be seen at the Itumabahal arch from the 16th century, the main arcade of the Bhaktapur Durbar from the 17th century, the arc of Chhusya Bahal from the reign of Pratap Malla, the arches at various temples in the valley, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact of Art and Culture on Health</h3>

<p>Any community&#39;s socioeconomic situation and artistic culture have a significant impact on the health of its residents. It has an impact on people&#39;s consciousness, knowledge, and perception of health and sickness, as well as social beliefs, values, beliefs, religions, traditions, customs, arts, and cultures. Alcohol and smoking are frequently combined in some cultures, which is harmful to health. This has previously been considered. Speaking of architecture, if a person builds a house improperly, they run the risk of having physical accidents, respiratory issues, skin conditions, acne breakouts, infections spread by insects and rodents, allergies, and other conditions. With the assistance of an engineer, it is crucial to make new or renovated homes, buildings, monasteries, and temples earthquake-resistant because failure to do so could have a negative impact on people&#39;s health. The use of colors or metals in various forms of fine art, such as architecture, painting, sculpture, and woodcraft, should be chosen with the understanding that they do not endanger human health.</p>

<h3>Origin of Castes and Ethnic Groups in Nepal</h3>

<p>There are 36 castes and four races in Nepal. Nepal is a multilingual, multicultural, multireligious, and multiethnic nation. As a result, Nepal is a country rich in ethnicity, language, culture, and religion. Based on social customs, family ties, and labor, Nepal&#39;s population was split into the four primary races of Brahmin, Chhetri, Vaishya, and Sudra. The distinctive and striking quality of this is the diversity and variety.</p>

<p>The National Census of 2068 states that there are 125 castes in Nepal. According to this, the Hill Brahmin population is 12.2 percent and the Chhetri population is 16.6 percent of the overall population. Magar, Tharu, and Tamang are the third, fourth, and fifth main castes, with 7.12, 6.56, and 5.81 percent respectively. In the Kusunda caste, the population is at its lowest (only 273 persons).</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Population of Nepal&#39;s Ten Main Castes</strong></p>

<p>Following is a brief discussion of some of Nepal&#39;s various castes, including their history and current status:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Brahaman/Chhetri</strong>

	<ul>
		<li>According to Dor Bahadur Bista, who was one of the Aryans who contributed to the development of Vedic and mythological Hinduism and culture, the Brahmins arrived in Nepal after traveling from West Asia through Panjab, India, and the plain created by Gangaji. These people are the Khas Brahmins&#39; forebears. Prem Khatri, a cultural expert, states that the Brahmins traveled from West Asia through Afghanistan to the Indus and Ganges river valleys before continuing on to the northern Himalayas. In a similar vein, it is claimed that throughout the Aryan era in the Persian Gulf, society was organized into various classes, including priests, fighters, warriors or rulers, and other working class. In the Rigvedic culture, these administrators were referred to as the warrior class or fighting classes. They were thereafter referred to as Chhetris. Brahmins and Chhetris are regarded as being of Caucasian ancestry in terms of ethnicity. They enjoy referring to themselves as Khas Aryans. Due to the fact that they wear sacred thread (janai), they are also known as Tagadhari. The Upadhyaya and the Jaishi are the two basic divisions of the Brahmins. Similar divisions exist between Purbia and Kumai, Pahadi and Maithili Brahmin. Additionally, Brahmins have various surnames. A few names to think of are Acharya, Subedi, Sapkota, Rijal, Gautam, Kandel, and Bhurtel. They are dispersed throughout the nation&#39;s districts, from Mahakali in the west to Mechi in the east. They are discovered to be more engaged in religious practices, astrology, farming, and public service. The Chhetri are essentially divided into two groups: Thakuri Chhetri and Khas Khetri. The western, hilly region of Nepal is where you may find Matwali Chhetri. Because they consume too much alcohol, they are referred to as Matwali. Chhetris go by the surnames Thapa, Kunwar, Bania, Bista, Khatri, Khadka, etc. The Vedic eternal/Sanatan Hinduism is adhered to by Brahmins and Chhetris. They speak a dialect of Nepali that belongs to the Bharopeli language family and is written in the Devanagari script.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Gurung</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>In Nepal&#39;s ethnic makeup, the Gurung tribe of the Mongolian sect is distinctive. Culturalist Janaklal Sharma claims that before the Gorkha monarchy, Gurungs were segregated into various regions of western Nepal. The Hud tribes in the western region of Central Asia were the forefathers of the Gurung caste between the third and third centuries BC, according to ancient accounts of the caste&#39;s origins. The fact that the term Hud was originally Mongolian is mentioned. The first progenitor of this caste is thought to have been a man by the name of Chandra Singh, according to the Gurung lineage. Based on their ethnic group, the Gurungs are classified into four castes and sixteen castes. The sixteen castes are Dhabre, Kabachey, Kurumache, Jigre, Thorje, Dorjali, Rimali, Foz, Chorme, Pom Thi, Migi, Peiggy, Khatra, Yoj, Kholali, Sogun, and Thorjami in addition to the four castes of Ghle, Ghodne, Lama, and Lamichhane. Although the Gurung (Tamu), one of Nepal&#39;s indigenous tribes, are dispersed throughout the nation and abroad, Kaski, Lamjung, Gorkha, Manang in the Gandaki region, and Khol of Kaski are where they are most frequently found. Even though their ancestors were farmers and livestock keepers, it has been discovered that they were heavily involved in trade and government services, including the foreign and domestic armed forces. The Bhote-Burmese language family includes the Tamang language. Gurung is the mother tongue of the Gurng people. Gurungs practice Buddhism.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Magar</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Regarding the Magar&#39;s ancestry, there don&#39;t appear to be many trustworthy official sources. Some have even claimed that Magars and Gurungs are both Hud-related. It is believed that this hud&#39;s descendants crossed into Nepal from Tibet. The tribal people of Nepal are called Magars. Their home territory was referred to as the Magarat region. It encompasses vast tracts of land that are heavily snow-covered that are west of the Kaligandaki, east of the Karnali, north of the Chure mountain range, and south of the Himalayan region. Another name for this region is 12 and 18 Magarat. This includes a portion of Dailekh, Dolpa, and Marsyangdi. Other surnames were derived from the seven surnames, including Rana, Thapa, Pun, Aale, Roka, Gharti, and Budha. The primary occupations of this caste are farming, raising livestock, mining, making crafts, serving in the military, and working abroad.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Tharu</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Regarding the Tharu caste&#39;s origin and how they arrived and settled in Nepal, there are a variety of viewpoints. Some claim that these people entered Nepal from the northern section of India after traveling through the Thar Desert in India. Another theory holds that Muslims in the Indian subcontinent assaulted the Rajputs. Due to their dread of being attacked and destroyed, some Rajputs and their wives entered Nepal. Additionally, these Rajputs brought their employees. Later, it was claimed that the Tharu caste was created as a result of marriages between other castes and the wives of Rajput workers. One of the ethnic groups of Nepal is the Tharu caste. The Bharopeli language family is the home of Tharu&#39;s native tongue. The Shivalik Range and Terai area of Nepal serve as their mainland. The Terai districts from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west are rich in tharu. Their primary line of work is farming. The Tharus identify as Buddhists and lovers of the natural world.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Tamang</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The Tamangs can be thought of as the oldest indigenous tribe, having spent a very long time dwelling in the valley&#39;s hilly regions. In the eight bordering districts as well as the Kathmandu Valley, they are heavily populated. Tamsaling is the name of the Tamangs&#39; settlement area. There are essentially two ethnic groups among Tamangs: the twelve castes and the eighteen castes. Numerous surnames, including Yonjan, Moktan, Ghising, Singden, Waiba Samaden, Gole, etc., are among them. They primarily follow Buddhism. Their primary occupations are raising livestock, farming, practicing Thanka, and producing a variety of handicrafts.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Newar</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The Newar caste, which is regarded as one of Nepal&#39;s oldest and most economically and socially successful castes, has been socializing in Nepal since ancient times. Tribal people include the Newars, who reside in Kathmandu and important trading hubs beyond the Valley. Since they originated in Nair, India, they are thought to be known as Newars from an origin perspective. They are also said to have arrived in Nepal while Nanya, a king of Karnatak descent, was in power. Ram Kumar Pandey claims that the name Newar or Nair is connected to the term &quot;Nepal.&quot;&nbsp; The ancient Kirant and other Lichhivis people who had been drawn to Kathmandu at various points in history were known as Newar at the end of the Middle Ages. Only the valley was referred to as Nepal, and all the locals were called Newar. The Newar caste has a caste system, claims Dor Bahadur Bista. In the Newar community, there is a caste system that ranges from high Brahman to untouchable Dalit. Depending on their line of work, people are divided into the Brahmin and Sudra classes. They often live in two- or three-story homes made of raw or baked brick with Jhingati roofs.These castes primarily engage in trade and agriculture. They have also accepted the ethnic profession. They practice Buddhism and Hinduism, and there is religious tolerance among them.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Rai</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The Rai caste, which has a round face, a robust built physique, a Mongolian face, is tiny in stature and has a happy expression on its face. The Kirat dynasty has lived in Nepal from ancient times. They also go by the name Khambu. As a Matwali race, Rai are thought to frequently consume beer, fish, and meat. The main settlement regions of Nepal are Solukhumbu, Okhaldhunga, Khotang, Bhojpur, Sankhuwasabha, Dhankuta, Ilam, and Udaipur. Rai has numerous surname variations. Initially, there were meant to be ten different varieties of Rai, according to Janaklal Sharma. Their last names are referred to as Pachha. Aathdpre, Hochonghang, Salten, Ombole, Kulung, Ketra, Kyou, Khamla, Khaling, Bantawa, and Nevahang are examples of surnames belonging to the Rai tribe. They reside in a home with a grass roof constructed of dried stone, clay, and wood. They mostly work in the production of paddy, millet, cardamom, raising livestock, and creating paper.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Limbu</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Since Limbus are members of the same Kirat community ethnic group as Rai, they might be thought of as sharing Rai&#39;s origin story. East of the Arun River, Sankhuwasabha, Dhankuta, Tehrathum, Taplejung, Panchthar, Ilam, Jhapa, Morang, and Sunsari are home to the indigenous Limbu tribe of Nepal. In truth, the land between the Arun and Mechi rivers, which locals now refer to as the Limbuwan area, is where the Limbu people of Nepal originally settled. Numerous variations of the Limbu tribe exist, including Anthubo, Aandembe, Jabegu, Banam, Phaedap, Selley, Sigu, Thangden, and Tumbahamphe, among others. They engage in farming and raising cattle. Limbus practice Kirant religion and revere nature.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Sherpa</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The Sherpa tribe considers the northern portion of the Solukhumbu area to be their ancient home. The Sherpas are dispersing throughout the Himalayas, from India&#39;s Sikkim and Darjeeling to Nepal&#39;s Helambu and Solu. There are Sherpas in many of Nepal&#39;s hilly regions. Scholars have hypothesized that the Tibetan words &quot;sar&quot; and &quot;pa&quot; are where the name &quot;Sherpa&quot; of the Mongolian sect comes from. which is Arabic for &quot;people of the East.&quot; In light of this, it is stated in G.S. Grierson&#39;s 1909 book, Linguistic Later on, this term was typically used to describe people who lived in northeastern Nepal; in the Tibetan language, the term &quot;east&quot; is known as &quot;Sayar.&quot; Sherpa, as used in their language, denotes an easterner. These claims suggest that the Sherpas entered Nepal via Tibetan regions. Even if you look at the grounds for affirmation, modern Sherpas engage in Tibetan social, cultural, and economic activities. The number of castes and surnames among sherpas is unknown. There are essentially only two castes, such as Khadev and Khavdhu. In contrast to Khavdhu, Khadev is considered to be a higher caste. The surnames Gorja, Goparma, Gole, Chiayawa, Chhusherva, Dawa, Thaktu, Nejungwa, Pangdorje, Paldorje, Pinasa, Penacapa, Mande, Rongsherva, Lama Sherwa, and Salaka are among the most common among the Sherpa caste. These people work in agricultural and livestock farming. They practice Buddhism and speak a Vote-Burmese language. They are members of the Mahayan cult. The main festivals of this caste are Loshar, Dumji, Fangdi Lopso, Yajryang, Kangsur, Dhukapa Chichyu, Yungyun, and Chichiu.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Chepang</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The inhabitants of Chepang have a moderately white, flat nose, a large face, and a medium-sized head. A tribe in Nepal known as the Chepang is also known as the Praja/people. They occupy the Chitwan mountain slopes, etc. They typically live in traditional, one-story houses with dry grass covering the roof. Their traditional occupation is clearing bushes and forests on slopes, collecting wild roots, and hunting in the Makwanpur, Dhading, Gorkha, Lamjung, and Tanahu districts as well as in Banke, Bardiya, Nawalparasi, and Bara. In essence, they revere nature.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Thangad</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Native inhabitants of Nepal known as Urab are also known as Jhangad. Their towns stretch all the way from Parsa to Jhapa. They construct modest cottages and occupy riverbank locations. Agriculture, labor, and cattle are their main industries, and they also make handicrafts like dhakis, pirkas, mats, and so on. Their tongue is a member of the Dravidian linguistic family. They observe holidays like Phagupurnima, Dashain, and Durga Puja in their native language. In this caste, the priest is referred to as Dhami.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Thami</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Some people have even grouped the Thami tribes with the Kirant. The Thami people&#39;s social and cultural practices, as well as their language, seem to share many similarities with the Kirant. The indigenous Kirant clan includes a branch known as the Thami tribe. The villages where they reside include Suspa, Rangthali, Chirangathali, Suitapang, Kalinchok, Lapilang, Khopachagu, Alampu, Siskar, and Bunthali, among others. Their financial situation is dire. They work in conventional agriculture and livestock farming. They worship nature and practice the Kirant religion.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Dhimal</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>It is challenging to make a claim about the Dhimal caste&#39;s ancestry with certainty in the lack of trustworthy evidence. It appears from a number of social, cultural, and historical texts that the Dhimal and Limbu castes share a common ancestor. Numerous historical accounts claim that Subba, who resided in the Himalayas following the Muslim conquest, belonged to the Hong caste. In the future, one of their offspring lived as a limbu and the other as a Dhimal. After some time, Limbu moved to the upper portion of the hill and Dhimal to the bottom. Janak lal Sharma cited the Limbu statement in this context. Tagera, a limbu, and his mother Ding Ding were the first fathers that the Dhimals believed in. The Dhimal are their descendants. The Terai Kirati, also known as the Jhapa and Morang districts, are home to the majority of the Dhimals, an ethnic tribe with a Mongol face feature. They live in a one-story house with a roof constructed of dry grass and bamboo. They revere the natural world. The Burmese family that voted for them has an impact on their language. They observe Hindu religious holidays such as Dashain, Tihar, Janapurnima, Chaitya Dashain, Maghe Sankranti, and others.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Thakali</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Thakali is another Himalayan tribal caste from Nepal. They are thought to have resided along the Thak River in the Mustang district, which is also the name of their caste. Some literature claim that this caste&#39;s roots can be found in Rajasthan, India, namely in the Sinja and Tibetan regions of Jumla. Thakali&#39;s capital city, Thassang, is located on the southern boundary of the Mustang district. They currently reside in various neighborhoods. They converse in their own tongue. They wear their own jewelry and costumes. The religion and culture of the Thakali are very similar to those of other Tibetan and Himalayan communities. The Thakali are made up primarily of the Gauchan, Sherchan, Tulachan, and Bhattachan ethnic groups. Many of the surnames are present in Sherpa, with the exception of these major castes.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Chhantyal</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The caste, which is one of the ethnic tribes, resides in Kuinemangle, which is part of the Myagdi district. They also reside in neighboring districts, including Baglung, Palpa, Rukum, Pyuthan, and Dang. They converse in Khaam. Although mining and processing were their primary occupations, they now largely work in agriculture and animal farming. Chhantyals don&#39;t have a lot of financial resources. They adhere to Hinduism. Their men wear shirts, Kachhad, Ishtakot, Docha, and Bhangra, while their women don Gunyo, Choli, Patuka, sparkling Faria, Lungi, and Mundri jewelry.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Barhagaule</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Baraguan, Among the native inhabitants of the Mongolian race is a caste. This caste resides in Mustang&#39;s central region, including Muktinath, Kagbeni, and Khusang. Their primary industries include farming, raising animals, and trade. These people are Buddhists.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Lepcha</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Lepcha have a physical structure with the Kirat as a whole. Lepcha, who reside in the area surrounding Kanchanjunga, have also traveled to India via Illam. The places where they reside include Fikkal, Rong, Pashupatinagar, Gorkha, Namsaling, and Sambalung in Illam and Jhapa. They revere nature and practice Buddhism. This caste, which is regarded as an ancient caste in Nepal, works with animals. They engage in basic farming and agriculture and grow millet, maize, buckwheat, and other crops.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Sunuwar</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The indigenous Kirant clan has a branch known as the Sunuvar tribe. They reside between Ramechhap and Okhaldhunga, to the east of Likhu. In Sunuwar, there are twelve surnames. Noxo is the name of the Sunwar&#39;s spiritual leader. They converse in the Vote-Burmese language family, Koech.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Danuwar</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Danuwar tribes occupy the area around the Bagmati, Kamala, and Sunkoshi rivers and are engaged in agriculture, paid labor, cattle farming, fishing, and hunting. The same may be said about Kathmandu, Nuwakot, Udaipur, Sarlahi, Sindhuli, Bhaktapur, Gorkha, Kaski, and Sindhupalchok, where they can be found strewn around. The worship of nature, Dhami, Jhankari, Tantrism, and supernatural power are more important to the Danuwars. Both flying marriages and arrange marriages are common among these people. The dead body is typically burned in this caste, and rites are typically performed for thirteen days.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Raute</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>The Route is a historically significant ethnic group and one of Nepal&#39;s poorest tribes. The only nomadic tribe in Nepal that relies on forest resources is called the Routes. The jungle between the Seti river in the Seti Zone, the Madi river next to Pyuthan on the east, the Chure hills in the south, and the Mahabharat chain in the north is where the majority of Raute live, according to Dor Bahadur Bista. In Doti, Darchula, Achham, Dailekh, Jajarkot, Kalikot, and Surkhet, they are primarily concentrated. The chief deities revered by the Routes are Baandevi, Doremisto, and Vhuyar. They speak their own indigenous language. They converse in Khamchi, a member of the Bhot-Burmese language family. They never stay in one spot for more than a month at a time, and they never return there. While the temporary shelter is known as a Thaila, these locations where they temporarily reside are known as Raute. Instead of farming, they favor jungle hunting and gathering wild bulbs.</li>
