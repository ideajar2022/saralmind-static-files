The body&#39;s tissues receive oxygen through red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia, as the name suggests, is brought on by a lack of iron. Your body needs iron to produce enough of a component in red blood cells that makes it possible for them to carry oxygen (hemoglobin). Thus, iron deficiency anemia may make you feel lethargic and breathless. When a body is unable to properly absorb iron, anemia is the main result.even when the youngster is getting adequate iron from their diet. Slow blood loss over time, frequently brought on by menstrual cycles or gastrointestinal bleeding. The signs include constant fatigue or weakness, a sore tongue, headaches, or vertigo. Most kids need 8 to 10 mg of iron each day because they only absorb a small portion of what they eat. The best strategy to prevent and treat iron deficiency is to consume a nutritious diet.

The symptoms of sickle cell anemia include Dactylitis, a painful swelling of the hands and feet, Anemia-related fatigue or irritability, Jaundice or icterus are yellowish skin tones or eye whites that happen as a result of a significant amount of red blood cells hemolyzing. Opioid painkillers (such as morphine), as well as anti-inflammatory drugs (for example, ibuprofen), Infection-fighting antibiotics. Examine the child&#39;s overall health and any related symptoms, such as pain or hematuria. administering replacement fluids and electrolytes reduces acidosis brought on by hypoxia, in order to maintain oxygen saturation, administer oxygen Restrain a child in bed to reduce energy use. Place the youngster in a relaxed position. Transfusion administration and monitoring.</p> -->

The defective hemoglobin that is produced causes incorrect oxygen delivery and red blood cell death. Thalassemia is primarily caused by an autosomal recessive disease. Pallors, low weight growth, enlarged liver, spleen, and unexplained fever are signs and symptoms of thalassemia. Iron overload can happen as a result of numerous blood transfusions. Chelation therapy with the drugs deferoxamine, deferiprone, or deferasirox is a potential treatment option for the iron overload associated with thalassemia. Because deferoxamine must be administered daily injections in order to be successful, long-term use is more challenging. It benefits from being reasonably priced and safe over the long term. The treatments include splenectomy and iron chelation therapy. Assess the youngster for the manifestation of clinical characteristics and complications for the overall management. administer blood transfusions using the appropriate safety measures. Watch out for signs of iron excess (abdominal pain, emesis, decreased a level of consciousness). Provide pre- and post-operative care if a splenectomy is necessary. If necessary, get ready for a bone marrow transplant.</p> -->

                                   <!-- <p>Acute rheumatic fever (ARF), commonly known as rheumatic fever, is an inflammatory condition that can affect the brain, heart, joints, skin, and skin tissue. Usually, the illness appears two to four weeks following a throat infection. Fever, several aching joints, uncontrollable muscle movements, and erythema marginatum, a distinctive but uncommon no-itch rash, are among the signs and symptoms. In nearly half of cases, the heart is implicated. When the bacterium Streptococcus pyogenic infects the throat, acute rheumatic fever may develop.The primary cause of RF is streptococcus pyrogens. The signs and symptoms of RF include a sore throat with fever, carditis, arthritis, subcutaneous nodules, and erythema. During the acute phase of an attack, all patients should be kept in bed rest. The length of time spent in bed should be extended until all signs and symptoms stop manifesting. For nursing management, if a kid had cardiac issues or was receiving diuretic medication, assess input and output every four hours or as needed.Penicillin and other alternative medications, such as erythromycin, should be used as key preventive measures in health education regarding illness prevention. Giving long-acting penicillin at intervals of three weeks up until the age of 18 will help with secondary prevention, as would maintaining frequent doctor checkups.</p> -->

                                   <!-- <p>By the eighth week of gestation, the DA, which derives from the distal dorsal sixth aortic arch, has fully developed. Its job is to divert blood away from the fetal lung that isn&#39;t working by connecting to the proximal descending aorta and the main pulmonary artery. Through the descending aorta and subsequently the placenta, where gas exchange will take place, the blood with a relatively low oxygen concentration from the right ventricle can be transported. 90% of the right ventricular output before birth passes through the DA. The fetus&#39;s premature closure is linked to serious morbidities, such as right-sided heart failure, which can lead to fetal hydrops. Infants who are premature may require more oxygen or ventilator support to breathe. A medication called indomethacin (in-doh-METH-ah-sin) aids in the closure of PDAs in premature newborns. The PDA tightens or constricts as a result of this medication, closing the opening. In most cases, indomethacin doesn&#39;t function on fully developed infants. Ibuprofen is also used to help premature newborns with PDA closure. This drug is comparable to indomethacin. Surgery is an option, but it has risks as well, including atelectasis, pneumonia, seizures, and pneumothorax. Assessing the child&#39;s current sickness, general health, prescribed medications, and other health issues is part of nursing management. Prior to surgery, get any necessary lab and diagnostic tests, and keep a regular eye on vital signs, a person&#39;s skin or mucous membrane color, capillary refill, peripheral pulses, oxygen saturation, and an ECG.</p> -->

It may be unilateral or bilateral may or may not be associated with cleft palate. It may vary from a small notch to a complete extending into the base of the nose and common in female children.Cleft palate is the abnormal opening in the root of the mouth resulting from a failure of fusion of the soft palate as week as hard palate growing from both sides right and left the side of the body during the embryonic period.The exact cause of the malformation is unknown. But the underlying causes are a multifactorial inheritance, environmental factor, and expose to teratogens such as alcohol, smoking, X-ray during pregnancy.In bilateral defect of the upper lip is unattached on both side and may be displaced forward.In severe case nostril on the affected side is low as well as a presence of deviated nose.A cleft lip may be detected with ultrasound beginning around the 13th week of pregnancy. As the fetus continues developing, it may be easier to accurately diagnose a cleft lip. A cleft palate that occurs alone is more difficult to see using ultrasound.Surgical correction of cleft lip is done in first few week of life if baby does not have a respiratory, oral and systemic infection. Name of surgery is Z- plasty to minimize notching of the lip from retraction of scar tissue and to lengthen the lip.</p> -->

Even so, it is reversible. A tooth can self-heal in the early stages of decay with the use of fluorides and other preventative measures (remineralize). The final stage of early caries is white patches. Only a dentist can fix a tooth if caries has broken the enamel and progressed to an advanced stage.The tooth will then be filled as part of the regular cavity treatment. The dentist will numb the region if a drill is used. A numbing shot is usually not necessary if a laser is utilized. The cavity is cleaned out of the decomposing matter and then filled.</p> -->

This defect may occur as separate entities or in combination with cardiovascular, renal, anorectal and radius deformities.An exact cause of the malformation is unknown, however, some association are most affected newborn have significant low birth weight and may have maternal polyhydramnios during pregnancy.Choking and coughing on feeds, may associate with cyanosis, respiratory distress, distended abdomen in case of distal fistula and scaphoid abdomen if no fistula.Surgical correction is done as soon as possible after birth. Surgical management depends on types on the anomaly, other associated anomalies, the general condition of the infant. Common surgical procedures are Thoracotomy with separation of the trachea with esophagus and ligation of fistula and end anastomosis of an esophagus.</p> -->

The circular muscle of the pylorus has hypertrophy, creating gastric outlet obstruction. It is unclear if this is a true congenital constriction or a functional hypertrophy of the muscles that occurs in the first few weeks of life. In the first few weeks following birth, the newborn is asymptomatic. Symptoms commonly appear in the second week of life. Vomiting: curdy type vomiting occurs after nursing and eventually rises in frequency and becomes projectile (1-2weeks). After vomiting, the newborn appears to be in good health and eager to breastfeed again. The exact origin is unknown; however, the underlying cause may be inherited- several members of a family may have had this problem when they were young. Surgery is the preferred treatment for pyloric stenosis. Pyloromyotomy is conducted by an incision in the right upper quadrant. A longitudinal incision is made into the pylorus circular muscle but not into the submucosa.</p> -->

This &quot;telescoping&quot; typically prevents anything from going through, whether it food or fluid. A rip in the colon (perforation), infection, or the death of bowel tissue can result from intussusception because the damaged area of the intestine does not get blood flow. For those unfamiliar, intussusception is a medical disorder in which one piece of the intestine invaginates (folds into) another section of the intestine, much to the way the sections of a collapsible telescope retract into one another. Traditional triad symptoms: stomach discomfort, a palpable sausage-shaped painful abdominal mass, and currant jelly stools (blood and mucus). Abdominal discomfort that comes on suddenly and causes the infant to weep uncontrollably; between attacks, the youngster seems OK. If a reduction fails, surgical intervention is considered. Laparotomy is the surgical procedure used to manually reduce the invagination and resect the nonviable piece of intestine.</p> -->

Depending on its cause, a hernia can develop quickly or over a long period of time.Common causes of muscle weakness include failure of the abdominal wall to close properly in the womb, which is a congenital defect and age.A common hernia in children is an inguinal hernia: it is the condition in which the abdominal contents such as large and small intestine, omentum, peritoneum or bladder protrudes into the inguinal canal. The child will be asymptomatic unless the abdominal contents are forced into the patient sac.Treatment of an inguinal hernia is surgery: Repairment of a hernia i.e. Herniorrhaphy. Other treatment includes: maintain intravenous fluid, medications, avoid heavy lifting for six to eight weeks after surgery.</p> -->

                                   <!-- <p>Worm infestation describes worms that reside within people&#39;s bodies as parasites. One of the most frequent causes of persistent parasitic infection in children in developing countries&#39; rural areas is intestinal worm infestation. Most often, school-aged children are affected (55-15). It is one of the leading causes of nutritional and health issues. These worms spread more quickly in areas with low sanitation and hygiene. The most prevalent worm infestation on earth is the roundworm. One of the biggest nematode parasites, measuring 20&ndash;25 cm, is the roundworm (10-14 inch).A little white worm called a threadworm lives in the ascending colon&#39;s caecum, rectum, and nearby ileum and ileum. For effective treatment, it is critical to identify the parasite, such as by looking for eggs, worm segments, or cysts. Additionally, management covers cysticercosis-related symptoms. antiepileptic medications if a seizure is present as well as supportive care for symptoms of cysticercosis. Avoid playing barefoot in the field where the soil may be contaminated with hookworm ova to prevent worm infestation. Hookworm ova enter the body through the foot, travel through the bloodstream, and develop into an adult worm.</p> -->

Signs and symptoms of mal-absorption include changes in stool, such as loose, bulky, watery, or noisy stools, as well as flatus. Check the vital signs, the level of serum electrolytes, the feeding pattern, the amount of fluid in the body, and any other clinical features.

It is brought on by hypolactasia, a lactase deficiency. Congenital alactasia, a complete lack of lactase brought on by a genetic abnormality, affects certain (rare) people and prevents them from being able to digest lactose from infancy. There are three different types of lactose intolerance: primary (normally brought on by aging), secondary (caused by illness or injury), and congenital or developmental. Lactose intolerance signs and symptoms include pains in the abdomen, bloating, diarrhea, and vomiting. Limiting the intake of milk and milk products but still consuming them in conjunction with other meals can help manage lactose intolerance.</p> -->

Some cereals contain a protein called gluten. The body has a difficult time absorbing nutrients, particularly fat, calcium, iron, and folate, due to the damage to the intestine. Chronic diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and anorexia are typical digestive symptoms.A week or month after wheat is added to the diet, the clinical course begins. Other characteristics include long-term short stature, failure to thrive, and muscle atrophy. When a patient consumes enough gluten, an intestinal biopsy reveals atrophy of the villous along with hyperplasia of the crests and abnormal surface epithelium. The child must adhere to a strict gluten-free diet, which forbids the consumption of wheat, barley, and rye. This kind of limitation is permanent.</p> -->

Blockage results in distension of the proximal intestine with solids, fluid, and gas; this result in pain, an increase in abdominal girth, and increased tension in the intestinal wall. Abdominal pain and cramps that come and goes in a wave. Infant typically pulls up their legs and cry in pain.

In this case, the rate of cell death exceeds the pace at which new cells may be generated by the bone marrow. When red blood cells are damaged, they release hemoglobin, a component responsible for transporting oxygen throughout the body. The average lifespan of a red blood cell is 90 to 120 days, after which the body naturally destroys and replaces the cells. Hemolytic anemia can be caused by a number of conditions, including a spleen that has grown too big, cancer, lymphoma, lupus, hepatitis, and other infections. Fatigue, pallor of the skin, fever, bewilderment, dizziness, and incapacity to undertake any activity are the clinical manifestations. Blood transfusions, intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroid drugs, and surgery are all viable alternatives for treating hemolytic anemia. The removal of the spleen may be necessary in extreme situations.</p> -->

A disorder characterized by a spinal column developmental abnormality in which the arches of one or more spinal vertebrae fail to fuse. Spinal bifida, which literally means &quot;cleft spine,&quot; is characterized by incomplete or defective brain, spinal cord, and meningeal development. The lumbar and sacral areas are the most commonly affected by the abnormality. Spinal bifida malformation is classified into two types: Spinal Bifida Occulta (hidden) and Spinal Bifida Cystic. The precise cause of spinal bifida is unknown. Scientists believe genetic, nutritional, and environmental variables are involved. Neural tube defects are caused by a teratogenic process that causes embryonic neural abnormalities to fail closure and differentiate abnormally. It happens between the 17th and 30th day of pregnancy. Swelling, a dimple in the skin, brain injury, paralysis, loss of sensation, blindness, convulsions, and other symptoms are common. Prompt surgery helps to prevent the additional nerve damage from infection and trauma but doesn&rsquo;t restore normal function to the affected part of the spinal cord.</p> -->

A severe respiratory illness that damages the lungs is known as pneumonia. When a healthy person breathes, little sacs in their lungs called alveoli fill with air. The alveoli are stuffed with pus and fluid when someone has pneumonia, which makes breathing difficult and reduces oxygen intake. Pneumonia can be brought on by viruses, bacteria, fungi, or protozoa, among other things. Chest tightness, a cough, a fever, dyspnea, tachypnea, chills, and breathing problems are all signs and symptoms of pneumonia.</p> -->

Additionally, a cough is a crucial respiratory system defense mechanism that aids in clearing the infected secretion from the trachea and bronchi. It is also one of the most prevalent symptoms of both acute and chronic respiratory tract infections.Keep the child warm in a comfortable position, encourage them to drink lots of hot beverages, give them steam inhalation if necessary, give them nasal decongestant according to prescription, and, if possible, encourage the child to bring out expectoration.

In particular when a youngster screams, it frequently results in a barking cough or hoarseness. The majority of croup cases are brought on by viruses, often parainfluenza virus but occasionally adenovirus or respiratory syncytial virus as well (RSV). Youngsters aged 6 months to 3 years are more likely to have viral croup, and those children also tend to experience its most severe symptoms. When they have a viral upper respiratory infection, some children are more vulnerable to getting croup. Laryngeal diphtheria, bacterial tracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, and laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis are different types of bacterial croup. The symptoms of croup include a &quot;barking&quot; cough, stridor, hoarseness, and breathing difficulties that typically get worse at night. It&#39;s common to compare the &quot;barking&quot; of a cough to the sound of a seal or sea lion. Viral croup typically has milder cases, but not always. The majority of children find that breathing in the humid air makes them feel better, and ibuprofen or acetaminophen (only in infants over 6 months old) may help them feel more comfortable. Rest and a lot of fluids are advised, as with most diseases. A youngster with croup may also need oxygen, and occasionally they are kept overnight in the hospital for observation.</p> -->

When urine in your bladder becomes concentrated, minerals in your urine start to crystallize and form bladder stones. Lack of complete bladder emptying frequently results in concentrated, stagnant urine. Some small bladder stones pass on their own, but your doctor might need to remove some of them. Bladder stones can result in infections and other problems if they are not managed. Prostate gland enlargement and neurogenic bladder inflammation are the most frequent causes of bladder stones, but other medical devices that are inserted into the bladder can also result in bladder stones. Even when their stones are huge, some persons with bladder stones have no issues.However, signs and symptoms may appear if a stone irritates the bladder wall or restricts the passage of urine. The symptoms listed here include lower abdomen pain, uncomfortable urination, frequent urination, blood in the urine, trouble urinating, or interruptions in the flow of urine. Surgery, medicine, and nurse management are all included in the course of treatment. Litholapexy, Cystolithotomy, and transurethral stone removal are surgical procedures.</p> -->

Premature birth, low birth weight, a family history of undescended testicles or other genital development issues, fetal diseases that can limit growth, such as Down syndrome, or an abnormality in the abdominal wall are the main causes of undescended testicles. Before the child&#39;s second year of age, orchidopexy is performed.

Because of the infection, inflammation, or scarring, pathologic phimosis develops. Adhesions between the epithelial layers of the inner prepuce and glans cause physiological phimosis. Scarring is a result of pathologic phimosis, such as bad hygiene, balanitis, or balanoposthitis. Circumcision (excision of the glans penis&#39; foreskin): This procedure is often carried out during infancy. Following surgery, a kid is monitored for bleeding and given analgesic medication for discomfort. A petrolatum gauze dressing is put and changed as needed.

They can also seem healthy. There are 5 phases of Wilm&#39;s illnesses. A physical exam, blood and urine tests, imaging tests like a CT scan and an MRI can all be used to diagnose Wilms&#39; tumors. Surgery and chemotherapy are the standard treatments for this condition. The surgical removal of kidney tissue is known as a nephrectomy.

                                   <!-- <p>The condition gigantism results in an individual growing taller than usual. A noncancerous tumor on the pituitary gland, which produces an excessive amount of growth hormone, is the cause of this illness, which most frequently affects youngsters. Giant children will develop extraordinarily tall statures, and many may experience delayed puberty. Unfortunately, because gigantism does not produce many symptoms besides high height, recognizing the illness can be challenging for parents. The child&#39;s genetic make-up or a growth spurt may be to blame for the family&#39;s abnormally tall stature. For a child&#39;s health and wellbeing, a gigantism diagnosis should be made as early as possible. Acromegaly is defined as a condition where growth hormone is secreted as a result of noncancerous tumors in the pituitary gland. That tumor produces too much growth hormone, which leads to a variety of symptoms like abnormally tall children, coarse facial features, disproportionately huge hands and feet, thick fingers, and more. All growth metrics are impacted by gigantism, though not always symmetrically. Excess insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is associated with systemic organ symptoms and gradual aesthetic deformity over time. Tall stature, mild to moderate obesity (common), an excessive growth of the hands and feet with thick fingers and toes, frontal bossing, hyperhidrosis, and other symptoms are examples of gigantism manifestations.</p> -->

                                   <!-- <p>Short stature is a symptom of dwarfism. As a result of a medical or genetic condition, it is described by the advocacy group Little People of America (LPA) as adult height of 4 feet 10 inches or below. The average height of an adult with dwarfism is 4 feet, despite the fact that other groups may raise the standard for some forms of dwarfism to 5 feet. The majority of illnesses connected to dwarfism are genetic, while other ailments have unidentified origins. Turner syndrome is a condition that only affects girls and women and is caused when a sex chromosome) is missing or partially absent. Achondroplasia is a condition when a person has one mutant copy of the gene associated with the disorder and one normal copy of the gene. Growth hormone insufficiency can occasionally be linked to a genetic mutation or injury, but for the majority of those affected, there is no known reason. Some of the issues related to dwarfism can be avoided or at least reduced with early diagnosis and treatment. Growth hormone can be used to treat people with dwarfism brought on by a lack of the hormone. Because many varieties of dwarfism are hereditary in nature, they are now incurable. Genetic testing can detect disorders that lead to dwarfism by looking for the precise variant that causes the condition.</p> -->

                                   <!-- <p>A rare condition called diabetes insipidus creates an unbalanced amount of water in the body. In this imbalance, there is excessive thirst that persists even after consuming fluids (polydipsia), and there is also excessive urine excretion (polyuria). Your body&#39;s inability to control how it manages fluids results in diabetes insipidus. Your kidneys often filter extra bodily fluids from your bloodstream. Before you urinate, this liquid waste is momentarily retained in your bladder as pee.Extreme thirst and the secretion of an excessive volume of diluted urine are the most typical indications and symptoms of diabetes insipidus. Other symptoms may include nocturia, the desire to get up throughout the night to urinate, and bedwetting. The hereditary etiology of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus that manifests at or soon after birth typically impairs the kidneys&#39; capacity to concentrate urine over the long term. Males are typically affected by nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, while females can carry the gene to their offspring. Assessment of the child&#39;s general health state, including clinical presentation, meticulous monitoring of intake and output, daily weight measurement, and administration of medications and hormonal therapy are all part of the nursing management of diabetes insipidus.</p> -->

Juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes were the previous names for type 1 diabetes in children. It is not known what causes type 1 diabetes. The body&#39;s immune system, which typically fights dangerous bacteria and viruses, mistakenly kills the insulin-producing (islet) cells in the pancreas in the majority of people with type 1 diabetes, according to scientists. This process may be influenced by genetics, and particular viruses may cause the disease to manifest itself. The signs and symptoms of type 1 diabetes in children typically appear quickly, over a period of weeks, and include blurred vision, excessive hunger, weight loss, irritability or other strange behavior, increased thirst, frequent urination, and extreme hunger. At first, receiving a type 1 diabetes diagnosis in a child can be extremely stressful. Suddenly, you and your child will need to learn how to administer injections, count carbohydrates, and check blood sugar, depending on your child&#39;s age. Nearly all of your child&#39;s major organs, including the heart, blood vessels, nerves, eyes, and kidneys, can be impacted by type 1 diabetes. The good news is that you may significantly lower your child&#39;s risk of developing these issues by keeping their blood sugar levels close to normal for the majority of the time.</p> -->

Hypothermia or fever, aureus, and neonates with sepsis may exhibit one or more of the symptoms and signs listed below. Lethargy, a weak cry, hypotonia, a refusal to suckle, and a lack of newborn reflexes. By setting up an IV line and administering fluid at a maintenance level in accordance with the baby&#39;s age for the first 12 hours, neonatal sepsis can be treated. Warmth should be provided, 10% glucose should be infused at a starting dose of 2 ml/kg, and the newborn should be regularly weighed. If vitamin K hasn&#39;t been administered already, inject 1 mg of it intramuscularly. If the situation has improved after three days of treatment, keep going for a total of ten days to finish the prescribed amount.

In terms of symptoms, the common cold manifests itself with fever, sneezing, rhinorrhea, trouble breathing, and so on. Likewise, An infected secretion is released from the trachea and bronchi, and a cough is a frequent sign of both acute and chronic respiratory tract infection as well as an important defensive mechanism of the respiratory system. Keep the child warm in a comfortable position, encourage the child to drink plenty of hot drinks, provide steam inhalation if appropriate, provide nasal decongestant as prescribed, encourage the child to bring out expectoration, and refer the child to a medical facility if the cough is not under control.</p> -->

The presence of a productive cough for at least three months over the course of two years is diagnostic of chronic bronchitis. A child&#39;s symptoms of inflammation and infection include a runny nose, sore throat, fever, chest ache, lethargy, malaise, etc. The use of a cold wet humidifier and acetaminophen for pain and fatigue are recommended, as are lots of hot beverages, relaxation, and no smoking. Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalosporin, and quinolone antibiotic administration. In order to avoid developing bronchitis while fighting off a cold or the flu, it is important to get enough of rest and eat well.</p> -->

Pleurisy, also known as pleuritis, is a disorder that affects the lining of the lung tissue and is often caused by an infection, illness, or injury to the respiratory system. There are two main categories of pleurisy: wet and dry. In the case of wet pleurisy, fluid builds up in the pleural space, making breathing difficult. Inflammation of the pleural space without the presence of fluid is known as dry pleurisy. A number of medical conditions, including as pneumonia, TB, and other respiratory infections caused by bacteria or viruses, and immune system disorders like systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, can lead to pleurisy. Pleurisy manifests itself clinically as a high temperature, quick shallow breathing, itching in specific areas of the back, dizziness, and a sudden, severe discomfort in the chest upon inspiration, which may be localized or extend to the shoulder or belly. Pleurisy can be prevented by not becoming exposed to dangerous substances and living a generally healthy lifestyle.</p> -->

Due to harm done to the developing brain either before or after birth, it is an incurable but not deadly illness.

Asymmetric movement, irritability, difficulty feeding, poor sucking, poor head control, and other symptoms are some of the clinical signs of cerebral palsy.Planning for management should be done collaboratively. Pediatrician, pediatric surgeons, pediatric nurse specialists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, pediatric social workers, child psychologists, teachers, special education teachers, family members, and parents all need to work together as a team. Promoting physical therapy-recommended exercise, using splints or braces to help with muscle control, motivating patients to practice self-care, and providing specially crafted self-care items are all ways to increase mobility and reduce deformity.</p> -->

                                   <!-- <p>Muscular dystrophies are a group of hereditary disorder with gradual atrophy of various skeletal muscle groups. It characterized by gradual onset in early life with an involvement of proximal muscles, loss of deep tendon reflexes and pseudohypertrophy of muscles. Initially, the muscle fibers swell, followed by hyaline degeneration and increased connective tissue formation. Infiltration of fat between the fibers may give the muscle an appearance of hypertrophy. The clinical features of muscular dystrophy are pseudohypertrophic muscular dystrophy, pelvic-femoral type,facio-&nbsp;scapulo- humeral type, distal myopathy, ocular myopathy and so on.Physiotherapy, exercise, walking and use of tricycle help to maintain ambulation and to prevent deterioration of muscular functions and contracture.</p> -->

Swollen lymph nodes, a worsening of the boils, a lack of oil drainage, among other clinical characteristics, are boils. Additional blood tests will be done if there are questions about how serious the illness is. If the illness is serious, the physicians could recommend antibiotics. If the boil is removed, a culture may be performed to identify the specific strain of bacteria that has infected the patient. Impetigo is a contagious superficial skin infection brought on by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus, just like other skin diseases. The clinical signs of impetigo include red sores, blisters on exposed skin, fever, elevated bacterial counts, crust that breaks off and leaves scars, and numerous lesions. Impetigo is treated with systemic antibiotics as well as topical use of an antibacterial cream such tetracycline erythromycin.</p> -->

                                   <!-- <p>A febrile seizure, sometimes referred to as a fever fit or febrile convulsion, is a type of seizure that is accompanied by an elevated body temperature (over 38&deg;C) but no significant underlying medical condition. Children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years experience them most frequently. The majority of seizures last less than five minutes, and within sixty minutes the child is entirely back to normal. The body will stiffen, the limbs and legs will start to twitch, the kid will start to lose consciousness, the breathing may become erratic, and the temperature will rise above 38&deg;C or 100.4&deg;F. Simple febrile seizures, complex febrile seizures, and febrile status epilepticus are the three different forms of febrile convulsions.Simple febrile seizures are distinguished by their shorter duration, lack of focal features, and total durations of less than 15 minutes if they do occur in series. If more than one febrile episode occurs within a 24-hour period or the seizure lasts longer than 15 minutes, it is considered to be complex and likely to have focal features. A febrile seizure lasting more than 30 minutes is referred to as a febrile status epilepticus. Up to 5% of febrile seizure cases may experience it. For both acute presentations and recurrences, the vast majority of people do not need treatment. It is advised to administer lorazepam intravenously to people who have ongoing seizures.</p> -->

                                   <!-- <p>Trisomy 21, sometimes referred to as Down syndrome (DS or DNS), is a genetic disease brought on by the presence of all or a portion of the third copy of chromosome 21. Physical growth delays, distinctive facial traits, and mild to severe intellectual handicap are frequently connected with it. A young adult with Down syndrome has an average IQ of 50, which is comparable to an 8- or 9-year-old child&#39;s mental development. Although the precise origin of down syndrome is still unknown, illness and a mother older than 35 seem to be risk factors. Management of recurring respiratory infections, otitis media, and other conditions, as well as routine monitoring of thyroid hormone, growth pattern, and injection of growth hormone as appropriate, are all included in therapeutic management.</p> -->

It is characterized by difficulties controlling behavior that is out of character for the person&#39;s age, difficulties paying attention, or excessive activity. These symptoms appear between the ages of six and twelve, last longer than six months, and cause issues in at least two contexts (such as school, home, or recreational activities). Toxin exposure, medications, damage to the central nervous system, prenatal problems, chromosomal abnormalities including Turner syndrome, and other factors are the main causes of ADHD.The use of behavioral therapies for ADHD is well supported by research, and they are the first line of treatment for children under the age of six or with moderate symptoms. Psychoeducational input, behavior therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal psychotherapy, family therapy, school-based interventions, social skills training, behavioral peer intervention, organization training, parent management training, and neurofeedback are examples of psychological therapies used.</p> -->

Signs and symptoms include ear discharge that is initially sparse and foul-smelling but later becomes moderate to profuse, yellow, purulent, and occasionally blood-stained; hearing loss that is conductive; bleeding; and perforation of the attic or posterolateral superior margin. Its medical treatment involves systemic antibiotic therapy, ear suctioning under microscopic supervision, and antibiotic drop instillation.

Early identification of risk circumstances (acidosis, hypoxia, and hypothermia) reduced kernicterus risk. Starting with the inner canthus of the eye and going outward in a single, smooth stroke, gently wipe the infant&#39;s eye with sterile cotton or soft gauze saturated with sterile water or saline. Before the operation, give the child nothing by mouth ( usually for 3-4 hours) Look for symptoms of central nervous system depression including as lethargy, hypotonia, poor sucking, convulsions, and high-pitched crying.</p> -->

It can happen as soon as a few weeks after contracting TB germs, or it might take years. The most frequent method for diagnosing TB is a simple skin test. If your chest X-ray shows signs of tuberculosis, your doctor may take samples of your sputum.</p>

<p>Antibiotic treatment for TB typically lasts between six and nine months. The most common medications used to treat tuberculosis are: Isoniazid, Rifampin, Rimactane, Ethambutol, Pyrazinamide.</p> -->
